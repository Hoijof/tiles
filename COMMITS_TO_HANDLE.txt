commit 83d1d28874efe5d587f101e742ca489fbdde6b74
Author: Steve Melenchuk <smelenchuk@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 21:01:24 2014 -0600

    Evokable: the phantom mirror.
    
    Single-use and stackable; it checks your evocation power against the
    target's MR to create a clone of the target whose duration also varies
    with evocation power.
    
    Has a really preliminary tile; tt could use detailing from someone with
    more artistic sense than I, or even a completely new tile.

commit 7514cc06760e159a4e083bbce848a88649d00cd1
Author: Steve Melenchuk <smelenchuk@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Mar 3 11:29:02 2014 -0700

    Update a couple of vaults for new species and minor issues.
    
    Includes one old species that was missed (gargoyles).
    
    Borrows the player tile for vine stalkers to give them a tile; these
    (and formicid enemies, which actually appear elsewhere) should get real
    tiles!
    
    Since felid enemies revive now, they've been removed from a couple of
    vaults where they could get killed on D:1 and respawn outside the vault,
    killing unaware players; the ideal behaviour here would probably involve
    them respawning inside the vault, but figuring out how to do that is a
    problem unto itself.
    
    A couple of cases where enemies could spawn with equipment
    unintentionally have also gone away.

    There are some tile discontinuities, so I suspect a bug in variant picking,
    or a misordering of the domino variants.

    The crown of Eternal Torment (Siegurt). Needs non-crappy tiles.
    
    Gives rTorment and reduces your maxhp by 35% (i.e., how much torment would
    do, since it also gives rN+++). Made it +3 and SInv for some nice symmetry
    with the other crown. It autocurses 100% of the time, which should help if
    being swappable makes it abusable (though I'm not convinced it would be
    anyway).
    
    Tiles are poorly-photoshopped copies of Dyrovepreva's. I am so, so sorry.

    Disable shadow traps temporarily after firing (elliptic)
    
    For 2-4 turns (amount can be calibrated). Mainly intended to
    reduce issues with batty enemies triggering traps repeatedly in
    a single turn.
    
    Might be possible to re-add these on earlier levels now, since
    they were only moved deeper because of bats.

    Deep Elf Summoner Reform
    
    Twas the night before the night before Christmas,
    when all through the house
    not a creature was stirring, not even a tentacled monstrosity
    The orb of Zot was hung between the Zot lungs with defiance and hate
    In hopes that qw wouldn't be late;
    
    Crazy Yiuf was nestled, snug in his bed
    Sigmund was stalking, filling n00bs with dread
    And Cerebov his robe and Lom Lobon in its wrath,
    Had just settled scores over some player's bones.

    Reform Elf Tiles
    
    The old elf tiles were bland and tepid. They didn't reflect the place
    of elves in the natural order of the dungeon. These tiles reform the
    essence of what it means to be elfish. Lovingly handcrafted in small
    batches, these little buddies protect the awesome Christmas presents
    hidden in Elf:$.

    Gell's Gravitas.
    
    A level 6 Hex/Translocation that pulls creatures towards a targeted
    creature, potentially causing lots of collision damage - it's basically
    a one-turn Singularity effect centered around a creature and without the
    direct gravitational damage.
    
    Appears in the book of the Warp and the book of Hinderance.
    
    "Gell" is intended to be pronounced with a hard G.

    L9 Tloc. Places a monster like Fulminant Prism that draws creatures that are
    within its radius closer to itself, pulls harder the closer they are, and
    deals damage to creatures that are sufficiently close. Lasts ~6-8 turns,
    dependent on power.

    A twisted resurrection of phoenixes, as Bennu in Tomb
    
    As little omnipresence avatars of a creation god linked to a sun god,
    another creator god, and an afterlife god, the Bennu have a wide spread of
    capabilities: as a comparsion point, they can be roughly described as no
    haste, regular-holiness executioners with sticky flame, holy, and draining
    attacks. Yes, holy; undead have it easy in Tomb. Alongside this, they've
    also got their own version of resurrection: a one-time instant deal near
    their original spot, and where either death involves an explosion of
    ghostly fire (which, remember, checks rN and heals undead).
    
    As per usual, Tomb and extended can use more non-undead, non-demonic enemies.
    Their vulnerability to torment should be fine, considering that they've got
    a way partially around it. They're slotted vaguely into the same spots that
    ancient champions are for the Tomb subvaults (i.e. where guardian mummies
    are placed, if it's not the classic layout subvault using more of those),
    with a few weight adjustments, plus rare out-of-depth placements and a
    tiny extra placement in Tomb zig floors.
    
    TODO:
     * Death message by blaze has several errors:
       "Killed from afar by bennu... with a set off by themself"
     * New tile.

    Hellemental hellsprings (Bring back wellsprings solely within Cocytus, zigs)
    
    Unique forms of debilitation are much maligned, and so are movement-binded
    genuine dangers. Still, there are hypothetically contexts for it to work.
    The hells, which encourage diving and rushing through its levels rather
    than clearing them due to the hell effects, general low value of small
    amounts of loot, and the high plateau of player power / xp in its position,
    should be the most ideal of them. At the very least, said hell effects can
    already dump weakling fodder onto the player and throw on a random negative
    status, so a monster that can try to do a little better than that is hardly
    out of place.
    
    It also serves as part of (unique) non-demon non-undead "threats" for
    extended, as is somewhat done currently with salamander firebrands in
    Gehenna, iron golems in Dis, ghost crabs in Tartarus, and the mechanical
    gap in resistances with Ds enemies versus demons for Pan. Cocytus is
    lacking in its elemental and dangerous aspects to some extent when compared
    to the other hells, anyway; some wellsprings sprinkled throughout the branch
    and the end vaults are another equalizing buff step besides even more fiends.
    
    (Also, coc_hangedman is slightly buffed due to its generous terrain compared
    to the other Cocytus end vaults; the open water is closed in a little, and a
    few more monsters are added in a few parts. The other ends were buffed slightly,
    too, and all have some small use of wellsprings.)

    roctavian's crystal guardian and guardian golem tiles (#8097).
    
    I clumsily edited the crystal guardian slightly to make it look less
    "pot-bellied", per roctavian's comments. If this still looks back,
    someone more experienced at tile editing will have to fix it.

    Unique: Vashnia, leader of the elite marksnaga squad.
    
    An HD 16 naga sharpshooter who also comes with various Blink spells,
    inherent Phase Shift, and a Shroud of Golubria that she can renew if it
    gets broken.
    
    Appears on Snake:2-.
    
    Historical note: Vashnia's original design had Disjunction as an escape
    spell; currently the escape spell is Blink Other, which accomplishes
    basically the same thing but with less visual impressiveness. Perhaps at
    a later date the possibility of this can be revisited.

    Android port.
    
    2 files are added to the root of the repository:
    * AndroidAppSettings.cfg: settings file required for Android SDL port. Will
      change on each minor release to reset configuration.
    * AndroidBuild.sh: script called by the Android SDL port to commence building
      the game itself
    
    It might be nice to be able to move them elsewhere, but for now, their
    presence here is required.
    
    The build process is documented in docs/develop/android.txt
    
    There's a TOUCH_UI compiler flag which sets all the things specific to a
    touch screen interface.
    
    There has been a large amount of changes in the Makefile for redefining where
    the dat/, saves/, etc. directories go, because the "install" part of the make
    isn't the final destination for these files under Android - the environment we
    deploy to is a separate device from the build environment.
    
    There is also a number of changes to the tiles interface. Some are specific
    to the TOUCH_UI, but others are also changed in USE_TILE_LOCAL.
    
    Touch only:
    * 'a'bilities menu goes straight to menu without prompting first
    * tap menu header to toggle/submit
    * menu instead of prompt to select which corpse to butcher
    * same for eating food from the floor (those 2 could go in local tiles too)
    * show_more defaults to false and less --more-- messages
    * pickup mode defaults to menu
    * defaults for tile_layout_priority is different (commands are more
      important than inventory)
    * popup for yes/no prompts, level-up stat gain and swapping rings (should
      be used for all prompts, and probably local tiles too)
    * spell casting: force selection menu
    * map mode: left-click rather than right-click for mouse mode; autotravel on
      left-click removed
    * remove skills training and memorisation panels
    
    Also local tiles (some could also be integrated in webtiles):
    * commands below description are clickable
    * clickable shopping menu (uses PrecisionMenu)
    * split the command panel in 2 (common actions and system commands)
    * add a map command panel
    * tapping or left-clicking the player is smarter:
      * picks up the item if there's one on the tile, otherwise
      * shows pick-up menu if there's several items on the tile, otherwise
      * traverses stairs (or enters a portal or shop) if one is present, otherwise
      * prays if an altar is present, otherwise
      * waits one turn
    * right-clicking the map enters map mode and brings the map commands tab to
      the front; map mode stays until exited rather than upon release of mouse

    some TODOs are already obsolete).

commit 4cd4b6875ad625556d4c0e805b124eb3f09cadf5
Author: Steve Melenchuk <smelenchuk@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon May 27 21:57:31 2013 -0600

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    The two new tiles are variants of the deep dwarf necromancer and greater
    naga respectively. Feel free to come up with something better in their

    New monster: orb spider.
    
    A spider with IOOD and the new M_MAINTAIN_RANGE flag.  Does not spawn
    randomly currently; has a vault on Spider:4-5 (default weight) for
    testing purposes.  Numbers probably need tuned, and it may need to be
    toned down with more cantrip slots.
    
    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    This highlights the path taken during the last exploration or travel,
    and should help make travel_delay=-1 less disorienting. The path is
    cleared when the player moves otherwise.
    
    In console, it is indicated with COLFLAG_REVERSE, which I'm not sure

    This was practically unnoticeable, but the tile was chosen at random
    instead of sequentially, as intended.
    
    Also, for whatever reason, the tiles were listed in reverse order, so
    the clock still ran backwards with the fix. I changed that, but maybe
    it was intended?

    It assumed all paletted images used colour keys; when they didn't, the

    darkest colour, this wasn't very noticeable, but still yielded some
    artifacts for tinted floor tiles, for examples.

    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed
    monsters) becomes packed_cell.halo, with either HALO_NONE, HALO_RANGE
    or HALO_MONSTER as value.
    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.
