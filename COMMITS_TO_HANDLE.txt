commit dafac1efff7dff52a947bb8959b2377e70a8c43f
Author: Eino Keskitalo <eino.keskitalo@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Oct 23 21:12:51 2011 +0300

    Zombie tiles for trolls, draconians, griffons, harpies and winged quadrupes (at least hippogrives, sphinxes and shedu). From #4282, by Lantier, modified a little.
    
    Strangely, the rim is correct in-game, although trolls don't have one, other tiles have, and no rim setting is in dc-zombies.txt.

    Add a ground/inv tile for boots of the spider (Bloax).
    
    The worn tile is still missing.

    Add Bloax' sweet cacodemon tile to UNUSED/.
    
    Here's a progress report about how doomed we are:
    
    ✓ various weapon-using zombies
    ✓ imp
        slightly hindered by 0.10-a0-1355-g43440df
    ✗ demon
        definable: a simple melee-only animal.  The name is too generic.
    └ spectre (perm_ench:invis)
    ✓ lost soul
        flying skulls (more faithful) and lost souls (name).
    ✓ cacodemon
        spells are definable, inertia on being shot not.
    ✓ hell knight
    └ baron of hell (exact rename with +hd)
    ✓ arachnotron
        orb spiders (could use a rapid-fire weapon)
    ✗ pain elemental
        definable: some eye spells:call_lost_soul
    ✓ revenant
        IOOD is a direct implementation of their weapon
    ✗ mancubus
    ✗ arch-vile
    ✗ spider mastermind
    ✗ cyberdemon
    ✓ some bastard that runs around and kills folks

commit 0445ba8e1880831027fab0e25c397d86d3bdffe4
Author: Adam Borowski <kilobyte@angband.pl>
Date:   Sat Sep 8 22:15:19 2012 +0200

    white_noise's update to his Arachne's tile, also a staveless version.
    
    The latter is used only as a base for the corpse, as both items she is
    allowed to wield (staff of poison and the Staff of Olgreb) fit the
    hard-drawn versions.  Technically, ordinary staves of poison might be
    something else than a stick with a green ball at an end, but blah.
    
    This is a slightly deboobified version compared to his submission,
    my apologies to connoiseurs.  Sorry guys (and at least one lady)!


commit 3b73544b84b478c0cfbdc9ec6dca3b5a638635a3
Author: Adam Borowski <kilobyte@angband.pl>
Date:   Tue Aug 14 02:26:06 2012 +0200

    wad's set of tree tiles.
    
    A few of them are sets of two on one tile, not sure if that's a good idea.
    This looks good and helps fight the grid effect, but on the other hand, some
    might have a problem with the tooltip saying "tree" in singular.

    Put a bunch of wad's plant tiles into UNUSED/, for use in vaults, perhaps.
    
    Flytrap and magic mushrooms are not fit for re-tiling but look like new
    monster ideas instead.

    wad's set of floor tiles.
    
    Probably too bright, but let's see how they'd look in their intended use.

    XuaXua's icon for constriction.
    
    Somehow, it looks pretty busy and hard to distinguish on a good deal of
    monsters I tried it with (first one being orc warlord).  This might be just
    my feeling though -- and above all, some tile is better than no tile.

    XuaXua's tiles for Mass Abjuration, modified Abjuration.
    
    The pentagram is yellow to make it differ somehow from actual summons which
    look too similar.

    Use dtsund's "tile" (ok, a square of yellow with 10% alpha...) for halo.
    
    Looks a lot better to me.  I'd give it rounded edges, but that'd take
    actual, you know, work.

    Un67's tile for ordinary staff.
    
    It's de-rimmed (the rim added by the autorimmer is not as thick), with no
    black in the texture and straightened a bit compared to the original.

    It actually fits worse than mine :(  The image is a tad better, but it holds
    weapon, shield and hat in wrong places.

    Slime tiles by roctavian and ontoclasm (#5911).
    
    For the acid overlays, I've used both the original directional
    overlays by roctavian and the altered floor tiles by ontoclasm. I
    think this looks suitably dangerous.

    Giant ants -> worker ants (coolio, Kekitalo).
    
    Yet another monster that uses "giant" as a modifier. Renaming them to
    "worker ant" puts them further in line with our hierarchy of ant-based
    monsters: queen ant, soldier ant, worker ant.

    New tiles: porcupine, fire crab. (Malwyn)
    
    Porcupines exist as monsters but haven't actually been defined yet.
    They'll probably replace <some> rats as a singular, slightly more
    difficult opponent that have spikey quills, etc.

    Add and use psyshvl's tentacle overlay tiles.
    
    I've added them via background flags, which seems odd at first, but
    works rather well.
    
    Krakens look much better now, though the angles still seem a bit
    sharp sometimes and would benefit from further tweaking.

    New unrand: Kryia's mail coat
    
    +7 Kryia's mail coat {DeviceHeal+++, rC+} (base type: scale mail)
    
    This artefact makes use of the refactored device heal code (further
    refactored in this patch) to increase device heal -- if you have no
    device heal penalties, this will double the healing you get from potions
    and wands.

    Sacrifice Resistance is {rF- rC-} and worth as much piety as sac hand.
    Sacrifice an Eye gives you 2x inaccuracy, like the amulet*2. It stacks with
    the amulet. It's worth 35 piety, like Sacrifice Skill.

    Move entropy weavers to brown p and clean up some tile data
    
    Entropy weavers are humanoids, so it makes sense to put them on p. They
    were only on x originally because I mistakenly thought all the p colors had
    been used. I put them on brown because they inflict corrosion.

    New monster: Entropy Weaver
    
    Entropy weavers have four weak-ish attacks and a word-of-recall-type spell,
    word of entropy. The spell applies 5 stacks of corrosion after a 3 turn
    chant delay; the weavers come with a small band of spiders to take advantage
    of the corroded player, but the weavers themselves become reasonably
    dangerous once you are badly corroded.
    
    Entropy weavers can be found mostly in Spider and Depths, but also rarely in
    Vaults.
    
    This monster needs a new tile.

    Add firecallers
    
    Firecallers are fire cultists with flaming melee and a spellbook including
    conjure flame and chant fire storm a spell that immobilizes the caster for
    3.5 turns and then calls down a fire storm on you. Think 'word of recall
    fire storm'. This is an attempt to make use of the interesting space opened
    up by word of recall.
    
    Firecallers are rare spawns in late D, as well as Vaults, Abyss and Depths.
    That might narrow after some testing.

    your skills based on the new values. ~35 piety.

    to 25. ~28 piety.

    Also, lower the MR to 80, and reduce the odds of them spawning anywhere
    in dungeon, and prevent a band from ever spawning in Dungeon.
    
    They're less likely to spawn in Dungeon than storm dragons, tengu
    reavers, deep elf annihilators, and war gargoyles.

    Add caustic wasps
    
    Caustic wasps are intended to add a top-tier fast, pack threat to
    depths analagous to killer bees in early Dungeon. In place of stacking
    poison, they stack corrosion via acid.
    
    The goal is to create in Depths the sorts of interesting situations
    killer bees create in Dungeon, and also to provide another type of
    top-tier threat in Depths.
    
    Tile is a placeholder.

    purposes). Both monsters still function the same.

    Rename Ru's Cataclysm to Apocalypse and adjust.
    
    'Cataclysm' was already part of a Qaz Invo title, so I'm changing
    it to 'Apocalypse'. I'm also reflavoring it to be more thematic with
    Ru's Awakening theme.
    
    Also, decreased the chances of doing only damage and increased the
    damage done by nearly 30% when no status is inflicted. I believe
    this should give a better feel of killing some of a group and
    incapacitating but not killing the majority.

    Update a couple of vaults for new species and minor issues.
    
    Includes one old species that was missed (gargoyles).
    
    Borrows the player tile for vine stalkers to give them a tile; these
    (and formicid enemies, which actually appear elsewhere) should get real
    tiles!
    
    Since felid enemies revive now, they've been removed from a couple of
    vaults where they could get killed on D:1 and respawn outside the vault,
    killing unaware players; the ideal behaviour here would probably involve
    them respawning inside the vault, but figuring out how to do that is a
    problem unto itself.
    
    A couple of cases where enemies could spawn with equipment
    unintentionally have also gone away.

    The crown of Eternal Torment (Siegurt). Needs non-crappy tiles.
    
    Gives rTorment and reduces your maxhp by 35% (i.e., how much torment would
    do, since it also gives rN+++). Made it +3 and SInv for some nice symmetry
    with the other crown. It autocurses 100% of the time, which should help if
    being swappable makes it abusable (though I'm not convinced it would be
    anyway).
    
    Tiles are poorly-photoshopped copies of Dyrovepreva's. I am so, so sorry.

    Might be possible to re-add these on earlier levels now, since
    they were only moved deeper because of bats.

    Twas the night before the night before Christmas,
    when all through the house
    not a creature was stirring, not even a tentacled monstrosity
    The orb of Zot was hung between the Zot lungs with defiance and hate
    In hopes that qw wouldn't be late;
    
    Crazy Yiuf was nestled, snug in his bed
    Sigmund was stalking, filling n00bs with dread
    And Cerebov his robe and Lom Lobon in its wrath,
    Had just settled scores over some player's bones.

    A twisted resurrection of phoenixes, as Bennu in Tomb
    
    As little omnipresence avatars of a creation god linked to a sun god,
    another creator god, and an afterlife god, the Bennu have a wide spread of
    capabilities: as a comparsion point, they can be roughly described as no
    haste, regular-holiness executioners with sticky flame, holy, and draining
    attacks. Yes, holy; undead have it easy in Tomb. Alongside this, they've
    also got their own version of resurrection: a one-time instant deal near
    their original spot, and where either death involves an explosion of
    ghostly fire (which, remember, checks rN and heals undead).
    
    As per usual, Tomb and extended can use more non-undead, non-demonic enemies.
    Their vulnerability to torment should be fine, considering that they've got
    a way partially around it. They're slotted vaguely into the same spots that
    ancient champions are for the Tomb subvaults (i.e. where guardian mummies
    are placed, if it's not the classic layout subvault using more of those),
    with a few weight adjustments, plus rare out-of-depth placements and a
    tiny extra placement in Tomb zig floors.
    
    TODO:
     * Death message by blaze has several errors:
       "Killed from afar by bennu... with a set off by themself"

    Hellemental hellsprings (Bring back wellsprings solely within Cocytus, zigs)
    
    Unique forms of debilitation are much maligned, and so are movement-binded
    genuine dangers. Still, there are hypothetically contexts for it to work.
    The hells, which encourage diving and rushing through its levels rather
    than clearing them due to the hell effects, general low value of small
    amounts of loot, and the high plateau of player power / xp in its position,
    should be the most ideal of them. At the very least, said hell effects can
    already dump weakling fodder onto the player and throw on a random negative
    status, so a monster that can try to do a little better than that is hardly
    out of place.
    
    It also serves as part of (unique) non-demon non-undead "threats" for
    extended, as is somewhat done currently with salamander firebrands in
    Gehenna, iron golems in Dis, ghost crabs in Tartarus, and the mechanical
    gap in resistances with Ds enemies versus demons for Pan. Cocytus is
    lacking in its elemental and dangerous aspects to some extent when compared
    to the other hells, anyway; some wellsprings sprinkled throughout the branch
    and the end vaults are another equalizing buff step besides even more fiends.
    
    (Also, coc_hangedman is slightly buffed due to its generous terrain compared
    to the other Cocytus end vaults; the open water is closed in a little, and a
    few more monsters are added in a few parts. The other ends were buffed slightly,
    too, and all have some small use of wellsprings.)

    Unique: Vashnia, leader of the elite marksnaga squad.
    
    An HD 16 naga sharpshooter who also comes with various Blink spells,

    Appears on Snake:2-.
    
    Historical note: Vashnia's original design had Disjunction as an escape
    spell; currently the escape spell is Blink Other, which accomplishes
    basically the same thing but with less visual impressiveness. Perhaps at
    a later date the possibility of this can be revisited.

commit f4002528321dbb23f92bade00d46ce515dd1bd27
Author: frogbotherer <therealchriswest@hotmail.com>
Date:   Sat Sep 8 13:40:44 2012 +0200

    Android port.
    
    2 files are added to the root of the repository:
    * AndroidAppSettings.cfg: settings file required for Android SDL port. Will
      change on each minor release to reset configuration.
    * AndroidBuild.sh: script called by the Android SDL port to commence building
      the game itself
    
    It might be nice to be able to move them elsewhere, but for now, their
    presence here is required.
    
    The build process is documented in docs/develop/android.txt
    
    There's a TOUCH_UI compiler flag which sets all the things specific to a
    touch screen interface.
    
    There has been a large amount of changes in the Makefile for redefining where
    the dat/, saves/, etc. directories go, because the "install" part of the make
    isn't the final destination for these files under Android - the environment we
    deploy to is a separate device from the build environment.
    
    There is also a number of changes to the tiles interface. Some are specific
    to the TOUCH_UI, but others are also changed in USE_TILE_LOCAL.
    
    Touch only:
    * 'a'bilities menu goes straight to menu without prompting first
    * tap menu header to toggle/submit
    * menu instead of prompt to select which corpse to butcher
    * same for eating food from the floor (those 2 could go in local tiles too)
    * show_more defaults to false and less --more-- messages
    * pickup mode defaults to menu
    * defaults for tile_layout_priority is different (commands are more
      important than inventory)
    * popup for yes/no prompts, level-up stat gain and swapping rings (should
      be used for all prompts, and probably local tiles too)
    * spell casting: force selection menu
    * map mode: left-click rather than right-click for mouse mode; autotravel on
      left-click removed
    * remove skills training and memorisation panels
    
    Also local tiles (some could also be integrated in webtiles):
    * commands below description are clickable
    * clickable shopping menu (uses PrecisionMenu)
    * split the command panel in 2 (common actions and system commands)
    * add a map command panel
    * tapping or left-clicking the player is smarter:
      * picks up the item if there's one on the tile, otherwise
      * shows pick-up menu if there's several items on the tile, otherwise
      * traverses stairs (or enters a portal or shop) if one is present, otherwise
      * prays if an altar is present, otherwise
      * waits one turn
    * right-clicking the map enters map mode and brings the map commands tab to
      the front; map mode stays until exited rather than upon release of mouse
    
    Some more details can be found in android_patch_notes.txt on #5677 (although
    some TODOs are already obsolete).

Author: Steve Melenchuk <smelenchuk@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon May 27 21:57:31 2013 -0600

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    It has an anti-wizardry effect, e.g. it negatively impacts spell success

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    Tiles for fauns, satyrs, and Pan from your favorite badtile author.
    
    (Yes, that's me, in case you were wondering.)

    Specifically, spriggan enchanters (based on the base spriggan and the
    air mage) and tengu reavers (based on the "tengu skald" tile with some
    cues taken from orc knights).
    
    These aren't *too* terrible, I hope.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, and Sojobo needing tiles.

    A spider with IOOD and the new M_MAINTAIN_RANGE flag.  Does not spawn
    randomly currently; has a vault on Spider:4-5 (default weight) for
    testing purposes.  Numbers probably need tuned, and it may need to be
    toned down with more cantrip slots.
    
    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    artifacts for tinted floor tiles, for examples.

    game javascript is now loaded asynchronically, which should fix the
    browser hang when starting a game.

    Show halo radius in tiles.
    
    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed
    monsters) becomes packed_cell.halo, with either HALO_NONE, HALO_RANGE
    or HALO_MONSTER as value.
    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    It's hard enough to get an idea of damage done from wound descriptions, no

    Almost dead:        1/6 => 1/5
    Severely damaged:   1/4 => 2/5
    Heavily damaged:    1/3 => 3/5

    Remove omndra's title screens.
    
    While I find them pretty cool, the author is unable to modify them to use
    the new title logo because he lost the source files. He also doesn't like
    them as much as Denzi's ones (style is quite different indeed).
    Put them under unused, so we can bring them back if someone can edit them
    with the new title logo.

    Add cloud with disturbance tiles for invisible monsters in cloud.
    
    This fix Mantis 2573.
    
    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.

    Make the silence overlay in tiles less gross.
    
    It was really obstructive, with parts of it being completely opaque. I was
    tempted to just make it a solid purple, but kept the grid look because it
    sticks out a bit better against halo effects (relevant for Mennas).

    use this floor inside the tartarus ending vaults?

    Denzi's new Pandemonium walls.
    
    In eight colours. I have also lowered the chance of the fleshy wall
    appearing in pandemonium, but it's still there. Unique pan lord levels get
    their own walls/floors (defined in pan.des) which aren't affected by this.

    Denzi's new pandemonium floor tiles.
    
    They come in 8 colours. This removes floor_tomb from pandemonium and gives
    the tiles version of it a similar random feel to the console version. The
    tiles might be worth editing a little still.

    A new (tiles) look for Tartarus (Denzi).
    
    It's much darker, and greener than before. The only problem is metal stands
    out a bit too much... I've made it use a dark metal tile in tartarus, but
    it's still grey instead of greenish like everything else. Luckily metal is
    rare in tar.
    
    Also, I made some small comestic adjustments to tomb, so the "wall of
    skulls" still has a place in crawl. It's most obvious on tomb:1.
