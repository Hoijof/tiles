    Tentacle hands for dolls from Pingas (#4687).
    
    They're displayed if the player has the mutation, is not an octopode, and is not wielding/wearing something in the hand. For non-octopodes, only Beastly Appendage gives tentacles, but once there's constriction, they should be considered as a normal and/or DS mutation.

    Several redone tiles and adjusted tiles from roctavian (#4805).
    
    Total redesigns: Asmodeus, Dispater, Ereshkigal, Hell Knight, Necromancer, Wizard. (The lords will actually soon be replaced by 32x48 designs.)
    
    The rest get a hand-drawn border, and some other (mostly minor) adjustments.

    Zombie tiles for trolls, draconians, griffons, harpies and winged quadrupes (at least hippogrives, sphinxes and shedu). From #4282, by Lantier, modified a little.
    
    Strangely, the rim is correct in-game, although trolls don't have one, other tiles have, and no rim setting is in dc-zombies.txt.

    white_noise's update to his Arachne's tile, also a staveless version.
    
    The latter is used only as a base for the corpse, as both items she is
    allowed to wield (staff of poison and the Staff of Olgreb) fit the
    hard-drawn versions.  Technically, ordinary staves of poison might be
    something else than a stick with a green ball at an end, but blah.
    
    This is a slightly deboobified version compared to his submission,
    my apologies to connoiseurs.  Sorry guys (and at least one lady)!

    Add roctavian's dryad and leshy tiles to UNUSED/
    
    They'd be forgotten otherwise.  There are currently no good plans how to fix
    the Forest monster set (they proved to be inadequate: damn hard vs melee and
    targetted spells, falling like flies to any effects that ignore EV).  While
    we'd need some ACy monsters, dryads and leshys can have medium AC if we'd
    stretch the theme slightly for bark-like skin, and both have a strong
    affinity to trees (animating trees? transforming into one?), so it's not
    unlikely the tiles will end up used after all.

    wad's set of tree tiles.
    
    A few of them are sets of two on one tile, not sure if that's a good idea.
    This looks good and helps fight the grid effect, but on the other hand, some
    might have a problem with the tooltip saying "tree" in singular.

    Slime tiles by roctavian and ontoclasm (#5911).

    overlays by roctavian and the altered floor tiles by ontoclasm. I
    think this looks suitably dangerous.

    Yet another monster that uses "giant" as a modifier. Renaming them to

    Added to credits. Added Curio to credits, also.
    
    Porcupines exist as monsters but haven't actually been defined yet.

    difficult opponent that have spikey quills, etc.

    times awesome.

    and wands.

    New monster: Entropy Weaver
    
    Entropy weavers have four weak-ish attacks and a word-of-recall-type spell,
    word of entropy. The spell applies 5 stacks of corrosion after a 3 turn
    chant delay; the weavers come with a small band of spiders to take advantage
    of the corroded player, but the weavers themselves become reasonably
    dangerous once you are badly corroded.
    
    Entropy weavers can be found mostly in Spider and Depths, but also rarely in
    Vaults.
    
    This monster needs a new tile.

    Firecallers are fire cultists with flaming melee and a spellbook including
    conjure flame and chant fire storm a spell that immobilizes the caster for
    3.5 turns and then calls down a fire storm on you. Think 'word of recall
    fire storm'. This is an attempt to make use of the interesting space opened
    up by word of recall.
    
    Firecallers are rare spawns in late D, as well as Vaults, Abyss and Depths.
    That might narrow after some testing.

    Rename caustic wasps again, this time to caustic bees
    
    Also, lower the MR to 80, and reduce the odds of them spawning anywhere
    in dungeon, and prevent a band from ever spawning in Dungeon.
    
    They're less likely to spawn in Dungeon than storm dragons, tengu
    reavers, deep elf annihilators, and war gargoyles.

    Add caustic wasps
    
    Caustic wasps are intended to add a top-tier fast, pack threat to
    depths analagous to killer bees in early Dungeon. In place of stacking
    poison, they stack corrosion via acid.
    
    The goal is to create in Depths the sorts of interesting situations
    killer bees create in Dungeon, and also to provide another type of
    top-tier threat in Depths.
    
    Tile is a placeholder.

    Mermaids are now sirens, and sirens are merfolk avatars and have been
    made gender neutral and had their descriptions redone. Both are now
    merfolk for purposes of cannibalism and pacification (and all other
    purposes). Both monsters still function the same.

    Rename Ru's Cataclysm to Apocalypse and adjust.
    
    'Cataclysm' was already part of a Qaz Invo title, so I'm changing
    it to 'Apocalypse'. I'm also reflavoring it to be more thematic with
    Ru's Awakening theme.
    
    Also, decreased the chances of doing only damage and increased the
    damage done by nearly 30% when no status is inflicted. I believe
    this should give a better feel of killing some of a group and
    incapacitating but not killing the majority.

    A new wizlab: Lehudib's Moon Base
    
    NOTE: This wizlab has double weight for now, which will be lowered to
    normal weight after a week or two of testing in trunk.
    
    Lehudib, whose famous writings on earth magic left few personal details,
    is said to have studied the power of magical crystal with single-minded
    devotion and in the most distant location imaginable. After traveling to
    some forgotten Moon and carving a fortress into its very surface, the
    wizard somehow convinced the bizarre surface creatures there to stand
    guard. Who can say what other knowledge this self-described Lunar Mage
    learned in such isolation? Adventurers who manage to reach the remote
    Moon Base of Lehudib may indeed find powers beyond their comprehension.
    
    This is a large and tough map featuring the legendary moon troll as a
    final guardian, which is always wearing moon troll leather armour if
    this hasn't generated (otherwise just artefact TLA). The moon troll is
    basically a speed 12, 18 hd iron troll with Singularity.
    
    The portal to the moon troll can appear with equal chance at one of 4
    locations on the map, with one or two paths available near the
    start. Each portal location has a sub-guardian, and there's an optional
    fight with the Lunar Statue (an OCS with Lehudib's Crystal Spear and
    Shadow Creatures) that guards an acquirement item.
    
    Monsters are earth, acid, or crystal themed, together with some eyes and
    the space-themed abyssal enemies for decisive Moon Flavour. Loot is
    mostly random, aside from the moon troll leather armour, a cure or
    beneficial mutation potion guarded by malmuters, and a randbook named
    after Lehudib with any one of earth/transmutation, earth/translocation,
    or earth/conjurations spells as the theme.
    
    For visuals this map uses a blue volcanic wall variant as stone and
    crystal walls with animated colours.

    Rename green crystal wall to simply crystal wall
    
    These walls are green by default but can be recoloured for e.g. portal
    vaults. This commit makes their description entry and all related values
    not refer to green, so that in-game descriptions won't be confusing in
    the rare instances when colour is changed.
    
    These walls can now have a feature name of simply crystal_wall in
    e.g. des files.

    An incredible masterpiece of heartbreaking perfection for player tiles
    
    Legends say that after creating this epic rendition of the mighty
    Jörmungandr, the Tile Master ascended to Godhood.
    
    I've made weapon and shield offsets that aren't the natural ones, but
    these don't cause visual artifacts in WebTiles.

Author: gammafunk <gammafunk@gmail.com>

    Evokable Jump attack ability
    
    * Player chooses a monster target within range where there's at least one valid
      landing site adjacent to the target.
    * There must be a monster to target to use the ability, but the monster can be
      friendly or neutral.
    * A random valid landing site is chosen, the player is moved to that square, and
      weapon melee occurs against the target at the landing site.
    * Jump attacks are melee with the wielded weapon and get a 20% damage bonus
    * Valid landing sites are always habitable squares with no monster and no
      thing that's dangerous to the player.
    * Flying monsters or giant monsters not standing in deep water or lava can
      'block' the path of a landing site by being in the ray path from the player to
      the landing site.
    * If a visible monster blocks the path to a landing site, it won't be considered
      as a valid landing site.
    * If something invisible blocks a landing site, the site will be shown as valid
      and can be randomly chosen, in which case the player 'rebounds off something
      unseen' and never leaves the starting square, but wastes a turn (delay 10aut).
    * If the player is adjacent to the monster, sites adjacent to the player are not
      valid; you have to 'jump over' the monster in this case.
    * Player can't jump if exhausted or standing in water/lava/liquefied ground
    * Exhaustion duration is set after jump (regardless of success) to prevent a
      second jump, with a duration formula that's the same as the breath duration.
    * The usual melee checks wielded weapon/friendly etc. checks are performed for
      the jump melee.
    * If any of the valid landing sites would cause problems with self-electrocution
      or sanctuary violation, the player is warned first.
    * Range is determined by evocations training; starting attack range is 3
      (movement 2), and it increases by one at evocations 5 and 10.
    * The cost of the jump is 2MP and a hunger cost using the same calculation as
      for flame breath.
    * The delay of a successful jump is the same as melee delay.
    * Fail rate for the ability calculation based on evoke taken from breath fail
      rate code

    Not that it really matters, since no one actually plays
    arenasprint (no one had seen this boss in more than a year),
    but it was still kind of embarassing having it around.
    
    The new sprite isn't ideal either, but I don't have the talent
    to render "a hairy body, a lioness' head with donkey's teeth and
    ears, long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of a bird with
    sharp talons." Maybe someone else can!

    Update a couple of vaults for new species and minor issues.
    
    Includes one old species that was missed (gargoyles).
    
    Borrows the player tile for vine stalkers to give them a tile; these
    (and formicid enemies, which actually appear elsewhere) should get real
    tiles!
    
    Since felid enemies revive now, they've been removed from a couple of
    vaults where they could get killed on D:1 and respawn outside the vault,
    killing unaware players; the ideal behaviour here would probably involve
    them respawning inside the vault, but figuring out how to do that is a
    problem unto itself.
    
    A couple of cases where enemies could spawn with equipment
    unintentionally have also gone away.

    The crown of Eternal Torment (Siegurt). Needs non-crappy tiles.
    
    Gives rTorment and reduces your maxhp by 35% (i.e., how much torment would
    do, since it also gives rN+++). Made it +3 and SInv for some nice symmetry
    with the other crown. It autocurses 100% of the time, which should help if
    being swappable makes it abusable (though I'm not convinced it would be
    anyway).
    
    Tiles are poorly-photoshopped copies of Dyrovepreva's. I am so, so sorry.

    New unrand - Gyre and Gimble (argonaut).
    
    This version differs from the original patch in significant ways; in
    fact, gameplay-wise, it's a whole new weapon. Instead of being,
    effectively, a two-hander for short blades (i.e., the best in terms of
    base damage that the class can provide), it's literally two strikes per
    attack. I added vorpal to it because that definitely lowered damage
    versus AC, and, of course, for the Jabberwocky reference.

    Turn rings of regen into amulets
    
    Rings of regen are notorious for encouraging tedious swapping,
    since they're at best marginally useful in combat, and quite
    useful outside combat. The amulet slot has a number of types
    that already discourage swapping (faith, guardian spirit,
    gourmand), which should at least ameliorate the regen problem
    somewhat; and if we later want to change regen to do something
    similar, it'll be a bit more intuitive if it's in the same slot.
    
    This also helps refresh the pool of amulets, which was starting
    to look a little shabby.

    A twisted resurrection of phoenixes, as Bennu in Tomb
    
    As little omnipresence avatars of a creation god linked to a sun god,
    another creator god, and an afterlife god, the Bennu have a wide spread of
    capabilities: as a comparsion point, they can be roughly described as no
    haste, regular-holiness executioners with sticky flame, holy, and draining
    attacks. Yes, holy; undead have it easy in Tomb. Alongside this, they've
    also got their own version of resurrection: a one-time instant deal near
    their original spot, and where either death involves an explosion of
    ghostly fire (which, remember, checks rN and heals undead).
    
    As per usual, Tomb and extended can use more non-undead, non-demonic enemies.
    Their vulnerability to torment should be fine, considering that they've got
    a way partially around it. They're slotted vaguely into the same spots that
    ancient champions are for the Tomb subvaults (i.e. where guardian mummies
    are placed, if it's not the classic layout subvault using more of those),
    with a few weight adjustments, plus rare out-of-depth placements and a
    tiny extra placement in Tomb zig floors.
    
    TODO:
     * Death message by blaze has several errors:
       "Killed from afar by bennu... with a set off by themself"
     * New tile.

    Hellemental hellsprings (Bring back wellsprings solely within Cocytus, zigs)
    
    Unique forms of debilitation are much maligned, and so are movement-binded
    genuine dangers. Still, there are hypothetically contexts for it to work.
    The hells, which encourage diving and rushing through its levels rather
    than clearing them due to the hell effects, general low value of small
    amounts of loot, and the high plateau of player power / xp in its position,
    should be the most ideal of them. At the very least, said hell effects can
    already dump weakling fodder onto the player and throw on a random negative
    status, so a monster that can try to do a little better than that is hardly
    out of place.
    
    It also serves as part of (unique) non-demon non-undead "threats" for
    extended, as is somewhat done currently with salamander firebrands in
    Gehenna, iron golems in Dis, ghost crabs in Tartarus, and the mechanical
    gap in resistances with Ds enemies versus demons for Pan. Cocytus is
    lacking in its elemental and dangerous aspects to some extent when compared
    to the other hells, anyway; some wellsprings sprinkled throughout the branch
    and the end vaults are another equalizing buff step besides even more fiends.
    
    (Also, coc_hangedman is slightly buffed due to its generous terrain compared
    to the other Cocytus end vaults; the open water is closed in a little, and a
    few more monsters are added in a few parts. The other ends were buffed slightly,
    too, and all have some small use of wellsprings.)

    Historical note: Vashnia's original design had Disjunction as an escape
    spell; currently the escape spell is Blink Other, which accomplishes
    basically the same thing but with less visual impressiveness. Perhaps at
    a later date the possibility of this can be revisited.

    Android port.
    
    2 files are added to the root of the repository:
    * AndroidAppSettings.cfg: settings file required for Android SDL port. Will
      change on each minor release to reset configuration.
    * AndroidBuild.sh: script called by the Android SDL port to commence building
      the game itself
    
    It might be nice to be able to move them elsewhere, but for now, their
    presence here is required.
    
    The build process is documented in docs/develop/android.txt
    
    There's a TOUCH_UI compiler flag which sets all the things specific to a
    touch screen interface.
    
    There has been a large amount of changes in the Makefile for redefining where
    the dat/, saves/, etc. directories go, because the "install" part of the make
    isn't the final destination for these files under Android - the environment we
    deploy to is a separate device from the build environment.
    
    There is also a number of changes to the tiles interface. Some are specific
    to the TOUCH_UI, but others are also changed in USE_TILE_LOCAL.
    
    Touch only:
    * 'a'bilities menu goes straight to menu without prompting first
    * tap menu header to toggle/submit
    * menu instead of prompt to select which corpse to butcher
    * same for eating food from the floor (those 2 could go in local tiles too)
    * show_more defaults to false and less --more-- messages
    * pickup mode defaults to menu
    * defaults for tile_layout_priority is different (commands are more
      important than inventory)
    * popup for yes/no prompts, level-up stat gain and swapping rings (should
      be used for all prompts, and probably local tiles too)
    * spell casting: force selection menu
    * map mode: left-click rather than right-click for mouse mode; autotravel on
      left-click removed
    * remove skills training and memorisation panels
    
    Also local tiles (some could also be integrated in webtiles):
    * commands below description are clickable
    * clickable shopping menu (uses PrecisionMenu)
    * split the command panel in 2 (common actions and system commands)
    * add a map command panel
    * tapping or left-clicking the player is smarter:
      * picks up the item if there's one on the tile, otherwise
      * shows pick-up menu if there's several items on the tile, otherwise
      * traverses stairs (or enters a portal or shop) if one is present, otherwise
      * prays if an altar is present, otherwise
      * waits one turn
    * right-clicking the map enters map mode and brings the map commands tab to
      the front; map mode stays until exited rather than upon release of mouse
    
    Some more details can be found in android_patch_notes.txt on #5677 (although
    some TODOs are already obsolete).

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    This imports the rod of clouds icon from 59d031e, adds in an icon for

    is itself a normal spell does not need to exist.

    It has an anti-wizardry effect, e.g. it negatively impacts spell success

    There's a minor adjustment here to item name code to get the noises to

    Let stone wall tiles vary by console colour.
    
    It might not be the best idea to be varying stone wall colours to begin
    with, but at the very least doing this will help us identify vaults that

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    Tiles for fauns, satyrs, and Pan from your favorite badtile author.
    
    (Yes, that's me, in case you were wondering.)

    A tile for Sojobo.
    
    Based on the tengu summoner tile with a few cues taken from other
    enemies.

    Basic tiles for two of the forest monsters.
    
    Specifically, spriggan enchanters (based on the base spriggan and the
    air mage) and tengu reavers (based on the "tengu skald" tile with some
    cues taken from orc knights).
    
    These aren't *too* terrible, I hope.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, and Sojobo needing tiles.

    The two new tiles are variants of the deep dwarf necromancer and greater
    naga respectively. Feel free to come up with something better in their

    New monster: orb spider.
    
    A spider with IOOD and the new M_MAINTAIN_RANGE flag.  Does not spawn
    randomly currently; has a vault on Spider:4-5 (default weight) for
    testing purposes.  Numbers probably need tuned, and it may need to be
    toned down with more cantrip slots.
    
    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    the clock still ran backwards with the fix. I changed that, but maybe

    Various monster tile improvements from roctavian (#4869).
    
    New tiles for: blizzard demon, iron devil, red devil, guardian
    serpent, aizul, josephine, tengu.
    
    I also put the other tengu tiles into UNUSED so they're at hand
    if/when we add more tengu monsters.

    New blood splat tiles (omndra #4612).
    
    Improved colouring and transparency.
    Consistency with corpse blood colour.
    More variety of shapes.
    Some wall bloods have inscriptions. Those ones will only be used on level
    generation and only on south facing walls, because rotated inscriptions are
    not so hot. And they are rare.

    I really don't like the whole packed_cell thing and how many changes
    are necessary to add this kind of tile; much of packed_cell is just
    replicating flags from map_cells. I'll have to check if this can be
    simplified.

    Fix wrong colour key handling in the rltile tool (#4824).
    
    It assumed all paletted images used colour keys; when they didn't, the
    first palette entry would be transparent. Since that was mostly the
    darkest colour, this wasn't very noticeable, but still yielded some
    artifacts for tinted floor tiles, for examples.

    Webtiles JS Modularization, part II.
    
    This organizes the game-specific javascript into proper modules, and
    converts all messages from Crawl to JS objects. This means that the
    game javascript is now loaded asynchronically, which should fix the
    browser hang when starting a game.

    Show halo radius in tiles.
    
    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed
    monsters) becomes packed_cell.halo, with either HALO_NONE, HALO_RANGE
    or HALO_MONSTER as value.
    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    While I find them pretty cool, the author is unable to modify them to use
    the new title logo because he lost the source files. He also doesn't like

    Put them under unused, so we can bring them back if someone can edit them
    with the new title logo.

    Add cloud with disturbance tiles for invisible monsters in cloud.
    
    This fix Mantis 2573.
    
    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.

    A new (tiles) look for Tartarus (Denzi).
    
    It's much darker, and greener than before. The only problem is metal stands
    out a bit too much... I've made it use a dark metal tile in tartarus, but
    it's still grey instead of greenish like everything else. Luckily metal is
    rare in tar.
    
    Also, I made some small comestic adjustments to tomb, so the "wall of
    skulls" still has a place in crawl. It's most obvious on tomb:1.
