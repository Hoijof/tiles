    Remove special cloud disturbance tiles.
    
    The unseen monster tile was already drawn on top of these, so the change
    shouldn't be noticeable.
    
    Also fixes wrong cloud tile shown with disturbances in some situations
    (#10002). It was caused trying to use disturbance versions for clouds
    that didn't have them.
    
    Basically reverts commit caa5519827a693b714aaff1417e64fc9d533b1d4.

    +7 Kryia's mail coat {DeviceHeal+++, rC+} (base type: scale mail)
    
    This artefact makes use of the refactored device heal code (further
    refactored in this patch) to increase device heal -- if you have no
    device heal penalties, this will double the healing you get from potions
    and wands.

    Replace a few straggling NULLs with nullptr.
    
    Most of the occurrences in the main codebase had been replaced already,
    with a couple of exceptions.  Replace those, as well as some NULLs in
    the level compiler, the tiles tool, and header file generators.
    
    There are almost certainly some lurking null pointers masquerading as
    literal zeros.  Fix those if you see them.

    It was a fairly complicated and not very noticeable effect. Blood saints also
    no longer damage themselves on casting destruction, so the limited synergy
    there no longer exists. Leaves blood saints with only one spell, but that one
    spell is actually 6 spells and so still leaves them with plenty of variety. The
    elixir card now just applies a direct heal to allies instead of the ephemeral
    infusion effect.

    Remove the Flight spell.
    
    There remain sources of the effect in potions, rings, randarts, boots,
    species, and the Tornado spell. The spell is the weakest link here: it has
    very little cost (only the investment to cast a level 3 spell), can be
    renewed infinitely unlike more interesting ones, and can be kept up
    permanently at little cost but with an annoying interface.
    Even without the redundancy, Flight is rarely interesting in combat, and
    spells do non-combat effects poorly.
    
    Book of Dreams gets Silence, which seems vaguely thematic. Book of the
    Dragon gets Flame Tongue, on |amethyst's suggestion. Book of the Sky gets
    Lightning Spire. Book of Air gets nothing; it's already a well-rounded
    book, and plenty of starting books have only 5 spells.

    Remove goliath beetles from vaults (and the game).
    
    Having them spawn only inside vaults is arguably the worst of both worlds
    -- the player sees them often enough to be annoyed, but not enough to get
    used to the annoyance.
    
    Vault appearances were replaced by other slow monsters, other bug-themed
    monsters, or sometimes nothing (if they were an option in a list). Orb
    beetles get turned into orb golems. erik_ogre got removed since it was a
    really weird vault. Rod of the swarm gets doubled chance of getting a spider.
    The enum is kept around as a genus monster for the two remaining beetles.

    They were another slow melee-only monster, and their digging ability didn't

    used in a few joke vaults.

    A coloring is specified as:
    
    %domino N E S W
    
    For example, we could place '0 1 0 0' next to '0 0 0 1'.
    
    The four parameters should be non-negative 8-bit integers. To simplify
    the generated code, emit a bit-packed representation of the coloring.

    Gives rTorment and reduces your maxhp by 35% (i.e., how much torment would
    do, since it also gives rN+++). Made it +3 and SInv for some nice symmetry
    with the other crown. It autocurses 100% of the time, which should help if
    being swappable makes it abusable (though I'm not convinced it would be
    anyway).
    
    Tiles are poorly-photoshopped copies of Dyrovepreva's. I am so, so sorry.

    Remove poisonous chunks.
    
    They're mostly a hassle if you have rPois but are not wearing it all the
    time, or may as well be clean if you permanent rPois. In Lair branches,
    the only place where they're really concentrated, you can just as well eat
    some of the tons of permafood that generates; food is certainly not a
    problem in most games that get that far. And if we want to limit the
    number of chunks you can get, restricting them behind a random resistance
    is not the right way to go. No other resistance has any kind of strategic
    effect in this way.
    
    Ignite poison checks for innate poison spells now, so monsters nagas will
    still be affected.

    A new wizlab: Lehudib's Moon Base
    
    NOTE: This wizlab has double weight for now, which will be lowered to
    normal weight after a week or two of testing in trunk.
    
    Lehudib, whose famous writings on earth magic left few personal details,
    is said to have studied the power of magical crystal with single-minded
    devotion and in the most distant location imaginable. After traveling to
    some forgotten Moon and carving a fortress into its very surface, the
    wizard somehow convinced the bizarre surface creatures there to stand
    guard. Who can say what other knowledge this self-described Lunar Mage
    learned in such isolation? Adventurers who manage to reach the remote
    Moon Base of Lehudib may indeed find powers beyond their comprehension.
    
    This is a large and tough map featuring the legendary moon troll as a
    final guardian, which is always wearing moon troll leather armour if
    this hasn't generated (otherwise just artefact TLA). The moon troll is
    basically a speed 12, 18 hd iron troll with Singularity.
    
    The portal to the moon troll can appear with equal chance at one of 4
    locations on the map, with one or two paths available near the
    start. Each portal location has a sub-guardian, and there's an optional
    fight with the Lunar Statue (an OCS with Lehudib's Crystal Spear and
    Shadow Creatures) that guards an acquirement item.
    
    Monsters are earth, acid, or crystal themed, together with some eyes and
    the space-themed abyssal enemies for decisive Moon Flavour. Loot is
    mostly random, aside from the moon troll leather armour, a cure or
    beneficial mutation potion guarded by malmuters, and a randbook named
    after Lehudib with any one of earth/transmutation, earth/translocation,
    or earth/conjurations spells as the theme.
    
    For visuals this map uses a blue volcanic wall variant as stone and
    crystal walls with animated colours.

    vaults. This commit makes their description entry and all related values
    not refer to green, so that in-game descriptions won't be confusing in
    the rare instances when colour is changed.
    
    These walls can now have a feature name of simply crystal_wall in
    e.g. des files.

    New monster: Entropy Weaver
    
    Entropy weavers have four weak-ish attacks and a word-of-recall-type spell,
    word of entropy. The spell applies 5 stacks of corrosion after a 3 turn
    chant delay; the weavers come with a small band of spiders to take advantage
    of the corroded player, but the weavers themselves become reasonably
    dangerous once you are badly corroded.
    
    Entropy weavers can be found mostly in Spider and Depths, but also rarely in
    Vaults.
    
    This monster needs a new tile.

    Firecallers are fire cultists with flaming melee and a spellbook including
    conjure flame and chant fire storm a spell that immobilizes the caster for
    3.5 turns and then calls down a fire storm on you. Think 'word of recall
    fire storm'. This is an attempt to make use of the interesting space opened
    up by word of recall.
    
    Firecallers are rare spawns in late D, as well as Vaults, Abyss and Depths.
    That might narrow after some testing.

    Rework Gozag's gold distraction to use a player duration
    
    Rather than tie it to specific piles of gold, use a duration and prop on the
    player to keep track of when to distract monsters. This fixes a number of
    issues with the previous implementation: players are no longer encouraged to
    avoid picking up fresh gold or to kite monsters to it, and the effect can still
    be triggered if the monster is exploded into chunks.
    
    Functionally this strengthens the effect somewhat, since individual piles of
    gold no longer expire one by one - the effect stacks for as long as the player
    keeps refreshing the duration by killing new things.
    
    Rather than display a status light constantly, the gold line on the HUD is
    highlighted while distraction is active.

    Merge unborn into death knights
    
    Unborn were thematically a fairly weird remnant of monster deep dwarves. Death
    knights now have spell set of agony, haunt, and injury mirror, taking the more
    noticeable spells from the two spell sets and dropping a number of mostly
    insignificant ones. Their entire spell set is also changed to be priestly,
    rather than having a mix of wizard and priest spells as unborn used to
    (they could also easily be reflavoured as spellcasters like hell knights and
    necromancers instead, but having a mix of both just seems confusing, even
    with spell types now displayed on xv).

    Sacrifice Skill gives you -1 to all skill aptitudes and recalculates all

    Sacrifice experience takes two experience levels and limits your max XL
    to 25. ~28 piety.

    Disable shadow traps temporarily after firing (elliptic)
    
    For 2-4 turns (amount can be calibrated). Mainly intended to
    reduce issues with batty enemies triggering traps repeatedly in
    a single turn.
    
    Might be possible to re-add these on earlier levels now, since
    they were only moved deeper because of bats.

    Remove Forceful Dismissal
    
    In a lot of cases it'd just be more useful to spend MP on summoning more things
    rather than explode your summons, but it was also thematically just not a
    Summoning spell, giving the school a way to deal a bunch of direct damage.
    Spells like Fulminant Prism do that sort of thing with a Summonings component
    in a better way.

    The orb of Zot was hung between the Zot lungs with defiance and hate
    In hopes that qw wouldn't be late;
    
    Crazy Yiuf was nestled, snug in his bed
    Sigmund was stalking, filling n00bs with dread
    And Cerebov his robe and Lom Lobon in its wrath,
    Had just settled scores over some player's bones.

    batches, these little buddies protect the awesome Christmas presents
    hidden in Elf:$.

    New unrand - Gyre and Gimble (argonaut).
    
    This version differs from the original patch in significant ways; in
    fact, gameplay-wise, it's a whole new weapon. Instead of being,
    effectively, a two-hander for short blades (i.e., the best in terms of
    base damage that the class can provide), it's literally two strikes per
    attack. I added vorpal to it because that definitely lowered damage
    versus AC, and, of course, for the Jabberwocky reference.

    Appears in the book of the Warp and the book of Hinderance.
    
    "Gell" is intended to be pronounced with a hard G.

    New unique: Robin of the Strong Arm
    
    A very early-game hobgoblin unique (currently at D2-4); about
    twice as tough as a hobgoblin, but placing with a mob of goblin
    & hobgoblin minions, and with the ability to buff them (with
    Battlecry) and hurl them at the player.
    
    As a nice piece of early-game loot, she has a guaranteed
    helmet, like Crazy Yiuf's cloak. Implementation uses the Nikola
    Hack (equipping it in her shield slot), alas.
    
    (The code for goblin tossing is extremely bad and shameful.
    I am sorry.)

    Remove the SDL dependency from the rltiles tool.
    
    Since the tool only needs to load PNG images, it doesn't really need
    SDL; we can instead directly call libpng. This should make
    cross-compilation easier and even reduces the code size a bit, since
    libpng can do the palette expansion for us.

    Remove Blessed Blades
    
    TSO blesses a weapon with holy wrath brand and two ?EW now, just like
    the capstone branding of Kiku and Lucy. Demon weapons are converted to
    different base weapon types just as before, no change.
    
    Existing weapons that are affected will be converted to their plain types.
    Stats of the "blessed" long blade base types have been aligned with their
    un-blessed counterparts in case some slipped through.
    
    Mennas and daevas received a slight weapon upgrade to compensate: They no
    longer can generate with falchions, and weapon pluses were increased by a
    bit more than 1 on average.
    
    [wheals: chrisoelueller's commit message here does not exactly make it clear
    what the motivation is, partly because i expect he found it self-evident. At
    any rate, having a special effect for just long blades added fairly little,
    but led to much confusion in terms of what TSO blessing would do, and in
    terms of what an item you got from an angel actually _was_.]

    Caustic wasps are intended to add a top-tier fast, pack threat to
    depths analagous to killer bees in early Dungeon. In place of stacking
    poison, they stack corrosion via acid.
    
    The goal is to create in Depths the sorts of interesting situations
    killer bees create in Dungeon, and also to provide another type of
    top-tier threat in Depths.
    
    Tile is a placeholder.

    Remove Peek at Two.
    
    In the past 4 new Nemelex wins, it was used... 4 times. This isn't
    surprising; Nemelex already gives enough ways to make a deck more
    predictable and less dangerous, and one that prevents you from using the
    more powerful ones is only going to be useful if it has a vastly greater
    utility.
    
    The fact that it was instant was quite possibly not noticed, and it does
    lead to an interesting idea: in an emergency, peeking so that you know
    what this deck will get you into. But Triple Draw is generally better for
    that, unless you have 3 decks to spare to peek at in succession (and at
    that point the piety cost would, I assume, exceed Triple Draw's).
    
    More importantly, the other abilities are _fun_, and preventing you from
    using them just feels like it's spoiling that. Deal Four, for example,
    wasn't used much more than Peek at Two, but it's an iconic ability that
    feels different every time.

    Introducing Ushabti, guardian mummy dilution for Tomb
    
    Guardian mummies, the main fodder in Tomb, are awkward if functional designs.
    Slow, melee-only amassed monsters with a punishing effect for killing them has
    obvious value in countering mass conjurations, but a few will go to great
    lengths to avoid or diminish their effects through, say, luring seperation
    tactics or the previous summoning effect. Some of this is arguably due to
    the psychological damage of statdrain, rot, and lighter draining amounts,
    which, while repairable concepts each and of themselves (plus eventually
    replacable), are also only used in any serious amounts in this branch anyway.
    This suggests an attempt to dilute rather than replace the death curse bombs
    known as guardian mummies.
    
    The ushabti, more light ancient Egyptian lore, are funerary figurines intended
    to serve as workers and servants for the dead in the afterlife. Their
    introduction cuts into the appearance rate of guardian mummies by 2/5s.
    They're non-living, have stats not very far away from guardian mummies but
    with more resists, and provide more flavour / non-demonic non-undead placements
    for extended. While they're still push-overs for when they appear alone,
    especially since they're still slow like guardian mummies, they've got two
    tricks that should make them rather relevant in Tomb:
    
     * Loud shouts, louder than dragon roars (The ushabti rumbles deeply! x6).
       Obviously relevant in the quietness of Tomb, and considering the monster
       use possibly a replacement enough of it.
     * A new spell, "Death Rattle". This breathes a line of randomly-mixed miasma
       and draining clouds, similarly to the petrifying breath of catoblepae.
       They don't cast it too often, though a little more when at low health:
       the movement this suggestions to avoid clouds with effects close to the
       lighter death curses should be a rather interesting incarnation of the
       intent of guardian mummy death curses, considering how often one is pinned
       down in Tomb.

    Tweak short blades
    
    Three changes:
    
    (1) All shortblades are now piercing, not just daggers/qbl. This
    simplifies matters considerably, removes a point of frequent
    confusion (for even surprisingly experienced players!), and is
    probably a buff for weak weapon types, for those lunatics who
    fight hydras with short swords.
    
    (2) Accordingly, the cutlass weapon type has been renamed, to
    'rapier'. The captain's cutlass is now, once again, its own weapon
    type. (It is now the only slicing short blade.)
    
    (3) Short blades' vorpal ego is now called "piercing", not
    "stabbing". Stabbing is a word that has a meaning in crawl, and it
    is not what that ego did! (This was another point of confusion for
    unspoiled players.)

    Draconians now get their breath weapons given on the fly, rather than
    hardcoded in mon-spll.h. Arguably this is uglier, but it's a lot simpler
    for both the coder and the player; this was prompted, for example, by
    |amethyst pointing out that classed grey dracs had Draconian Breath listed
    in xv.

    Level 5 Conj/Tmut. Does heavy damage to adjacent foes (and
    malmutates them, for flavour), but contaminates the caster; 2-4

    around with contam mechanics and tmut/contam interactions & add

    Currently in the Book of Alchemy and the Book of
    Transfigurations. (Ice Form has been moved from the latter to the
    Book of Ice, per Grunt's suggestion.)

    tiles of monsters that have never been, tiles of monsters that were removed,

    be kept, with exceptions granted to the smaller pan/hell lord tiles and the

    If anybody wanted to use any of those tiles, they can find them in the git

    so explicitly.

    Turn rings of regen into amulets
    
    Rings of regen are notorious for encouraging tedious swapping,
    since they're at best marginally useful in combat, and quite
    useful outside combat. The amulet slot has a number of types
    that already discourage swapping (faith, guardian spirit,
    gourmand), which should at least ameliorate the regen problem
    somewhat; and if we later want to change regen to do something
    similar, it'll be a bit more intuitive if it's in the same slot.
    
    This also helps refresh the pool of amulets, which was starting
    to look a little shabby.

    Make mimics cackle & vanish into a puff of smoke!
    
    Mimics historically have served two purposes. They were "the
    absence of the expected", whether that expected thing was an
    item, a branch entrance, a shop, etc; and they were a threat, a
    monster that tried to attack you when you discovered them.
    
    The former worked pretty well. The latter does not. They are
    quite weak, as enemies, and have been ever since constriction
    was nerfed. They can't really be buffed, either, since actually
    threatening/lethal mimics would encourage resting before walking
    next to stairs/items/etc, at penalty of mimicy death. Neither
    doing so, nor forgetting to do so & dying, sounds very fun.
    
    So, let them focus on what they're good at. When discovered,
    mimics now cackle & vanish in a puff of smoke; this retains their
    main function ("not being [x]", surprising/annoying/amusing the
    player), without dragging out the joke longer than it's worth.
    
    The current implementation interacts oddly with effects that
    discover mimics from a distance (Ashenzari & antennae & Assassin,
    the boots of the), since mimics now vanish instantly whenever
    discovered, even if the mimic wouldn't have noticed the player
    before. It might be possible to improve this, with some
    intermediate 'semi-discovered' state?

    A twisted resurrection of phoenixes, as Bennu in Tomb
    
    As little omnipresence avatars of a creation god linked to a sun god,
    another creator god, and an afterlife god, the Bennu have a wide spread of
    capabilities: as a comparsion point, they can be roughly described as no
    haste, regular-holiness executioners with sticky flame, holy, and draining
    attacks. Yes, holy; undead have it easy in Tomb. Alongside this, they've
    also got their own version of resurrection: a one-time instant deal near
    their original spot, and where either death involves an explosion of
    ghostly fire (which, remember, checks rN and heals undead).
    
    As per usual, Tomb and extended can use more non-undead, non-demonic enemies.
    Their vulnerability to torment should be fine, considering that they've got
    a way partially around it. They're slotted vaguely into the same spots that
    ancient champions are for the Tomb subvaults (i.e. where guardian mummies
    are placed, if it's not the classic layout subvault using more of those),
    with a few weight adjustments, plus rare out-of-depth placements and a
    tiny extra placement in Tomb zig floors.
    
    TODO:
     * Death message by blaze has several errors:

    Hellemental hellsprings (Bring back wellsprings solely within Cocytus, zigs)
    
    Unique forms of debilitation are much maligned, and so are movement-binded
    genuine dangers. Still, there are hypothetically contexts for it to work.
    The hells, which encourage diving and rushing through its levels rather
    than clearing them due to the hell effects, general low value of small
    amounts of loot, and the high plateau of player power / xp in its position,
    should be the most ideal of them. At the very least, said hell effects can
    already dump weakling fodder onto the player and throw on a random negative
    status, so a monster that can try to do a little better than that is hardly
    out of place.
    
    It also serves as part of (unique) non-demon non-undead "threats" for
    extended, as is somewhat done currently with salamander firebrands in
    Gehenna, iron golems in Dis, ghost crabs in Tartarus, and the mechanical
    gap in resistances with Ds enemies versus demons for Pan. Cocytus is
    lacking in its elemental and dangerous aspects to some extent when compared
    to the other hells, anyway; some wellsprings sprinkled throughout the branch
    and the end vaults are another equalizing buff step besides even more fiends.
    
    (Also, coc_hangedman is slightly buffed due to its generous terrain compared
    to the other Cocytus end vaults; the open water is closed in a little, and a
    few more monsters are added in a few parts. The other ends were buffed slightly,
    too, and all have some small use of wellsprings.)

    Rebalance crossbows
    
    Again as a result of the ranged weapons rebalance, crossbows
    needed to change. The analogy here is long blades' to bows'
    m&f; better return on skill investment & a higher power cap,
    but rarer.
    
    Hand crossbows are added as a starting type, "something like an
    armour-piercing dagger"; crossbows are upgraded to arbalests
    (a little worse than a glaive), and a new rare triple crossbow
    type is added on the top end (a little worse than a bardiche,
    though with a lower skill cost.) Please note that the triple
    crossbow historically existed & is extremely verisimilitudinous.
    
    Hellfire is now an arbalest, and Sniper is now a triple crossbow
    (well, a "heavy crossbow", since it has mindelay of 27 instead of
    22, and since I didn't want to have to change the sprite).
    
    All crossbows have a mindelay of at least 1.0; this is an attempt
    to differentiate them. Possibly something more ambitious will be
    attempted in 1.6, but this is a first step.

    Rebalance slings
    
    Slings numbers (along with the other launchers') needed to be
    rebalanced after the recent ranged combat rework. The approach
    here is essentially analogous to the staves skill; good return
    for xp investment, but a limited power cap, especially if you
    don't find the rare upgrade weapon type.
    
    Slings renamed to 'hunting slings' and upgraded from 2->5 base
    damage (and 12 base delay); new, rare "greatsling" added, with
    8 base damage and 14 base delay. Punk upgraded to the latter
    type.
    
    Thanks to Lasty for providing a baseline math suggestion!

    Remove potions of strong poison.
    
    Their peculiar depth restriction meant that when you found them, they were
    quite harmless. Even if the restriction were removed, they would be
    basically the same as potions of poison, since when they might be harmful
    the player would have little enough HP that the weaker potion could kill
    them.
    
    Their weight is distributed evenly among all other potions -- a very
    slight buff seems like a fine thing to do, especially since potion
    generation at D:2-10 isn't considered too good.

    Retheme arenasprint's "succubus" to "dimme".
    
    Not that it really matters, since no one actually plays
    arenasprint (no one had seen this boss in more than a year),
    but it was still kind of embarassing having it around.
    
    The new sprite isn't ideal either, but I don't have the talent
    to render "a hairy body, a lioness' head with donkey's teeth and
    ears, long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of a bird with
    sharp talons." Maybe someone else can!

    Remove the dragon slaying brand
    
    Generally it doesn't create interesting decisions because dragons are
    such a small group and are mostly a subset of monsters slowed by the
    freezing brand. In addition, it has rather arbitrary effects against
    players, hitting some for an degenerate amount of damage while ignoring
    others.

    Remove brown oozes.
    
    The idea behind them seems to be a simple upgrade to a jelly, rather
    than getting one of the more complicated and harder monsters like
    acid blobs/death oozes/azure jellies. The thing is, they generate only
    in Slime, outside vaults, and by then they're not very different from
    jellies, being mostly just "weak things that corrode." Even in the Slime
    entrance with 4 of them, which is all of them most games will see, they're
    already pretty weak. Slime itself has plenty of enemy variety and can
    stand the removal.

    Plus2: Combine all three enchant weapon scrolls
    
    New item is just called "scroll of enchant weapon".  It increases both accuracy
    and damage by 1.
    
    Enchant weapon III scrolls have been converted to stacks of 2 enchant weapon
    scrolls where placed in vaults, and if already generated will act like a common
    "scroll of enchant weapon" as well for sake of simplicity.
    
    Scroll weights have been adjusted a bit; this almost certainly
    needs to be revisited.
    
    [Committer's note: merged a few commits into this, where it seemed sensible.
    Also reworked the scroll weights, but yeah, that needs another pass.]

    Basically this has all the effects of a removal, but the elephant slug
    "stat block" remains as a dummy so Gastronok has a base type. The slugs

    One thing I've considered is turning Elephant Slugs into some other
    monsters, such as worms. "Slug" conveys the fact it is slow better than
    "Worm".

    better served with tomahawks before they find javelins. For one
    case where they could be useful (dispersal), tomahawks have been
    given a chance at the dispersal brand.

    Rename honeycombs royal jellies (PleasingFungus).
    
    The name works just as well with bee themes, but also fits with the
    occasional jelly theme that vaults have. I also feel that it's a bit
    more iconic.
    
    Thankfully the bikeshed doesn't even have to change colour -- they
    were always both yellow.

    Remove plague shamblers.
    
    The idea behind the miasma death explosion is interesting, but in
    general miasma can be extremely annoying and the cloud rather easy
    to avoid. This is especially true in the layout of Crypt, which is
    the only place they show up outside of vaults. The retching attack
    gave a rare special case that very rarely mattered and didn't help
    to distinguish them all that much.

    They have all the usual problems of summoners, stationary monsters,
    and special-cased interactions (with disintegration). Almost every
    single vault that had them was "OCS / silver statue / ice statue"
    or something like that, so fairly few actual changes had to be made.

    Rename the bow of Krishna to the longbow of Vishnu
    
    Bad Dungeons and Dragons are bad. mm'kay?
    
    This weapon name was an insult to anyone with the slightest clue about
    how RL Hinduism works. When it comes to gods, it's all about name-length-
    vs-weight. Having two gods attached to a single bow doubles the weight,
    makes referring to it clumsy (as the context suddenly matters), increases
    air resistance, and all that to... _reduce_ accuracy -- as two mythological
    references are less deadly than one deep one, especially if any theology is
    involved. Against religion, glancing hits don't really matter, and a double
    reference can only do those.
    
    Such arguments about realism might seem like busy work to people brought up
    on MMORPGs, but some of us do care.

    Sticky flame damage is hardly noticeable in D, and basically

    there are plenty of other evil fiery monsters.

    Remove vapour monsters
    
    Always confused, permanently invisible monsters that only know how to
    check your electricity resistance are not very fun to fight. For
    vaults, I've replaced many instances of vapours with wind drakes where
    the "air" is the theme, replaced a couple instances with lightning
    spires where the theme was electricity or with thorn hunters if the
    theme is merely swamp. Other instances have been outright removed. For
    the cloud mage wizlab, I've replaced vapours with wind drakes but have
    down-weighted them relative to air elementals and insubstantial wisps.
    
    For the foxfire card, I've moved vampire mosquitos into the position
    where vapours were, put insubstantial wisps as lower-power summons
    behind fireflies, since the latter got a buff some time ago, and added
    killer bees in between insubstantial wisps and fireflies to keep the
    number of summon types the same.

    There doesn't seem to be a very good place for these guys, as
    attested to by their rather limited placement (1/4 of the time, in
    a high-level spriggan band). They fill a similar niche as spriggan
    enchanters, and, absent the Forest branch, aren't common enough
    for their differences to be obvious.

    Remove Sunray
    
    Sunray had a number of quirks that were rather non-transparent if
    uninformed about them, and not usually very interesting from a
    tactical perspective (namely: it ignored repel missiles, did bonus
    damage to vampires and shadows, and couldn't hurt things that were
    invisible). There seemed a general agreement that it probably ought
    to simply be removed.
    
    Stone arrow replaces it in the spriggan druid spellbook.

    Replace Summon Ugly Thing with Summon Menagerie (pending a better name)
    
    Summon Ugly Thing was never a particularly impressive spell and the
    summon cap changes have left it even more underwhelming these days.
    Still, there is a need for a solid midrange summon available to good
    god worshipers, and this is a shot at assembling one that might be
    more interesting than the ubiquitous ugly things.
    
    The spell can summon either a manticore, lindwurm, harpy (multiples
    at higher power), or a sphinx (much rarer except at high power), which
    I feel are solid midrange creatures with a shared mythological theme
    and some relatively unobtrusive gimmicks (and more of an emphasis
    on ranged combat than its immediate 'upgrade' in Summon Hydra).
    
    Somewhat similarly to Shadow Creatures, multiple harpies count as a
    single creature for the purposes of the spell's cap, and the creatures
    also receive a modest HD boost based on high spellpower (I'm still
    somewhat divided on this, unlike with Ice Beast, but it does help the
    spell scale more strongly with spellpower that it otherwise would;
    perhaps there is some higher-tier creature accessible with high power
    that could help bridge this gap on its own?)
    
    As a natural consequence of Summon Ugly Thing being replaced, Kirke
    also acquires this spell. This is effectively a buff for her, but as
    one of the least dangerous midgame uniques, I am sure she can handle it,
    and a selection of Greek mythological beasts are surely at least as
    suitable things for her to summon as... whatever ugly things are.

    Remove Demonic Horde
    
    This was neither a popular nor powerful nor especially interesting
    spell, which was basically 'Call Imp, except a lot more of them'.
    Making the demons more individually powerful only further steps on
    the toes of the many other demon summoning spells that already
    exist, so I think it is fine to simply trim it.

    Since felid enemies revive now, they've been removed from a couple of
    vaults where they could get killed on D:1 and respawn outside the vault,
    killing unaware players; the ideal behaviour here would probably involve
    them respawning inside the vault, but figuring out how to do that is a
    problem unto itself.
    
    A couple of cases where enemies could spawn with equipment
    unintentionally have also gone away.

    of available through the rod of clouds), and Poison Arrow. A multi-spell
    rod which duplicates effects of other items and whose sole remaining spell
    is itself a normal spell does not need to exist.

     * Tukima's: Nerf blink_other statues health, actually give them
       a cast message against their given targets.
     * Eringya: Regulate faun/satyr placement a bit more,
       move the vine coverings from stone golems to earth elementals.
     * Doroklohe: Another large buff to golem set (now constructs set)
       as part of the upcoming golems trimming. Means doroklohe has a
       consistently ridiculous threat, at least.
     * Iskendrun: Fix deep elf mage spellset to properly emulate
       the base monster's spell set, randomize the door into the tower,
       some header clean-up.
     * Zonguldrok: Cut one ancient champion and make a gravestone-champion
       have a much worse chance that also delays his placement.
     * Cigotuvi: fix an unintended potential drop in loot,
       nerf the buffed renamed tentacled monstrosity due to constriction
       buff from ages back, use iron golem as base for flesh golem
       and edit description to explain any potential catches of the base
     * Wucad Mu: Upgrade several monks (iron troll to grey draconian monk,
       human to monstrous demonspawn), let wucad mu summon them and some
       thematic ghosts so it's much harder to kill him, heavily lower
       his health. Also, extend vault exploration length, and lower
       the maximum delay between effects from 400 aut to 300.
       [somewhat annoyingly, this involves quite a hack regarding
       ds bands, some bugs block vault redefinition of ds/dr, and
       the OCS boss is also still mediocre while disint is binary.
       Going to leave things ready for redefining monks again if the above
       bugs are fixed eventually.]
     * Lots of basically important tiny things, like clothing some
       unarmoured wizards.

    Don't generate racial weapons or launchers
    
    The effects of racial weapons were very minimal and unlikely to be
    noticed. Even if they were made significant, they would only apply to a
    very small subset of races. The only somewhat notable effect was Beogh's
    slight slaying bonus (and even that was very minor), this could be
    compensated for in some other way if necessary.
    
    Racial armour has slightly more noticeable effects and currently still
    remains, but could probably be removed too (potentially replacing the
    racial effects with armour egos instead).

    Crystal golem -> Crystal guardian (Grunt, tenofswords).
    
    Implementer's notes (Grunt):
    
    The spell Crystal Bolt is player-castable for possible future use with the
    "rod of bolts" (reworked rod of destruction), and crystal golems have been
    replaced 1:1 in vaults that used them.
    
    ---
    
    Designer's notes (tenofswords):
    
    Not every golem can be cut without scarring many a vault, and golems are
    very strongly themed to the point of reluctance with complete cuts.
    Still, they're golems, slow melee-only monsters with extreme defenses and
    excellent melee that thus encourage annoying tactics due to being unable
    to kill patient players but also being very difficult to kill. We certainly
    don't need nearly versions of this sort of monster as we currently do
    (goliath beetle, slugs and snails, golems, iron trolls, iron imp/devil,
    earth elemental); the only time this really works is in Dis, where
    there are hell effects and very nasty company to make sure that there's
    no time to use the slow strategies of avoiding being hurt much by golems.
    
    This serves as another change to a slow, melee-only monster for preserving
    some themes and flavours without outright cutting into the monsters available.
    These new crystal guardians once more have good defense and even better
    resists in exchange for bad health and zero EV, appear in numbers in most
    vaults, are boosted (to normal) speed, and get a ranged option; in this
    case, a bolt of fire or cold that happens to bounce off all walls, rather
    than just crystal, easily resisted by the caster in ricchoets. This is
    modelled off the decent-enough edits on minmay_guarded_unrand_dyrovepreva,
    and the name originates from there, too.
    
    Between crystal guardians and war gargoyles as less terrible material,
    I've got plans to edit out stone golems, clay golems, and iron golems
    out from basically everywhere but Dis:7 vaults, which should pave the
    way for essentially removing these three and dealing a decent blow to
    the multitudes of slow, melee-only, very difficult to destroy encounters
    in sheer differences of monsters, though mostly by changing vault-specific
    mediocre monsters rather than significantly impacting overall monster sets.
    For now, the patch has a near 1:1 replacement use with crystal golems, aside
    from most importantly adjusting (and upping) their use as rare D:12-16 OODs.
    
    Needs a new tile.

    Buff, speed up, move around metal gargoyles, rename to war gargoyles
    
    For monsters partially representative of one of the strongest current
    races plus primarily Dis:$ spawns, metal gargoyles are quite weak.
    While low health and few resists lets them be much more palatable
    as part of the group of slow, high defense pure-melee monsters, said
    group is very full and these serve as autofight-material at best.
    Thus, this patch gives them buffs to fit into a particular niche:
    fast, high ac, low hp, nasty ranged.
    
    This renames metal gargoyles and uses a flavour of explicit
    smithing preperation to buff their speed, give them maces, and lets
    them use a slightly weaker form of iron dragon metal splinters.
    Of course, there are also a few general stat buffs: rough health
    of deep troll shamans, the damage of merfolk impalers, see invisible.
    Imagine them as stone giants with halved health and less melee damage
    in exchange for haste, mild resists, weapons, and golem-level AC.
    
    It also adjusts their vault uses, and puts them as rare Vaults OOD
    spawns for both more V to D distinction and extra flavour.
    
    Further monster gargoyle changes echoing this would be appropiate;
    molten gargoyles with lava breath and higher HD for AF_FIRE to
    address the low focus on fire damage in Gehenna, rare occasional
    plain gargoyles a little harder hitting. Using these gargoyles to
    replace most iron golem uses would also be worthwhile; this was
    recently prompted by getting something to replace some vault golems
    with.

    Touch-up to Vashnia tile (þuþþy).

    Unique: Vashnia, leader of the elite marksnaga squad.
    
    An HD 16 naga sharpshooter who also comes with various Blink spells,
    inherent Phase Shift, and a Shroud of Golubria that she can renew if it
    gets broken.
    
    Appears on Snake:2-.
    
    Historical note: Vashnia's original design had Disjunction as an escape
    spell; currently the escape spell is Blink Other, which accomplishes
    basically the same thing but with less visual impressiveness. Perhaps at
    a later date the possibility of this can be revisited.

    Remove lava fish
    
    Stat-wise, they were extremely similar to lava worms (just slightly
    weaker) - so much so that I see no reason for them to exist given that
    they don't even really show up in the very narrow earlygame window
    where you might be able to even notice the differences between the two.
    
    Where lava fish occured, I have mostly replaced them directly with worms,
    barring a minor exception or two.

    Remove caps; rename wizards hats "hats."
    
    In the spirit of the glove/gauntlet and helmet types distinction removal, there
    doesn't seem to be much reason to have both caps and wizard hats. Hats are more
    common among unrands and wizards starting with hats is more "thematic" than
    some gladiators starting with caps. on the other hand, those gladiators starting
    with wizard hats would be pretty weird, so wizard hats are just hats now.
    
    Caps not removed:
    - Caps existing in old saves
    - Summon cap
    - Level cap
    
    This changes the percentages of hat brands from 2/3 MR and 1/3 int to 1/3 MR,
    1/3 int, and 1/3 spirit shield.

    undrainable.
    
    The directory name sucks and is a D&Dism -- sadly, "eldritch" is still not
    right as without the word having an in-game meaning it's mostly a synonym
    for "abyssal" which these critters are not.

    Bastardize double swords.
    
    Bad Star Wars are bad. mm'kay?
    
    These multiple swords were an insult to anyone with the slightest clue about
    how RL weapons work.  When it comes to swords, it's all about length-vs-weight.
    Having two blades attached to a single hilt doubles the weight, makes handling
    clumsy (as the orientation suddenly matters), increasing air resistance, and
    all that to... _reduce_ damage -- as two shallow cuts are less deadly than one
    deep one, especially if any armour is involved.  Against armour, glancing hits
    don't really matter, and a double sword can only do those.
    
    Such arguments about realism might seem like busy work to people brought up
    on MMORPGs, but some of us do care.

    Remove moths of suppression
    
    Suppression is a hugely complicated and inconsistent mechanic. Its
    original purpose was to be a way of overriding rPois in Spider but
    there are now plenty of monsters that do this effectively (and much more
    simply).
    
    [1KB: I moved this to trunk, as it made an already extremely hard to review
    branch massively more so.  There's nothing but a single enum to preserve,
    so compat break doesn't make this removal any easier or harder.]

    Remove the hydrataur.
    
    There's sadly a number of problems, caused by chimera code assuming every
    constituent creature is one-headed, and that the result has a _head_ of each
    of those.  The hydrataur instead is supposed to have a variable (not three
    unless cut) number of heads, all of them identical -- as opposed to chimeras
    with exactly three distinct heads.  The centaur and thrashing horror parts
    are not supposed to bring their heads, either.  Thus, we get each of them
    having a chance to be the "acting head", messages talk about "the" hydra
    head, etc.  And the description includes:
    
    "[...] It has the head of a hydra, the head of a thrashing horror, and the
    head of a yaktaur. [...]"
    
    Chimera code doesn't support vault redefinitions at all (name:, n_rpl, etc).
    The fastest way to fix would be thus making the hydrataur a proper monster
    on its own, based on a hydra: if the genus is MONS_HYDRA, it seems to work
    without further additions.  It can then toss those javelins, spray hellfire,
    etc, as in the joke learndb entry.
    
    bh doesn't seem to think it's worth the effort, so I'm removing it; please
    revert if you want to improve it instead.

    Rename "dragon" to "fire dragon"
    
    DRAGON now genus-only.
    
    Brief discussion history in 4d5c11a304968c3635d8b60075a0ab9b39d71d43.
    
    Summary of current brainstorm session:
    "Dragon" means "fire-breathing dragon" in European mythology because
    the other kinds never existed. In the world of Crawl however, there
    are many kinds of dragons - so it seems that people would have given
    the fire-breathing one a more distinctive name.
    Producing "fire dragon armour" from "fire dragon hide" also means less
    player confusion if a "fire dragon" dropped that hide.
    Red draconians and fire drakes also both get a fire-y qualifier.

    Add a player mutation granting the jump ability
    
    * Starting attack range is 3, like the evokations ability, increasing by one for
      each level of the the mutation to a max of 5.
    * Cost of ability is only hunger and exhaustion (same hunger cost as evokations
      ability).
    * The mutation ability otherwise functions exactly the same as the evokations
      ability.

Author: gammafunk <gammafunk@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Jun 15 23:23:16 2013 -0500

    Evokable Jump attack ability
    
    * Player chooses a monster target within range where there's at least one valid
      landing site adjacent to the target.
    * There must be a monster to target to use the ability, but the monster can be
      friendly or neutral.
    * A random valid landing site is chosen, the player is moved to that square, and
      weapon melee occurs against the target at the landing site.
    * Jump attacks are melee with the wielded weapon and get a 20% damage bonus
    * Valid landing sites are always habitable squares with no monster and no
      thing that's dangerous to the player.
    * Flying monsters or giant monsters not standing in deep water or lava can
      'block' the path of a landing site by being in the ray path from the player to
      the landing site.
    * If a visible monster blocks the path to a landing site, it won't be considered
      as a valid landing site.
    * If something invisible blocks a landing site, the site will be shown as valid
      and can be randomly chosen, in which case the player 'rebounds off something
      unseen' and never leaves the starting square, but wastes a turn (delay 10aut).
    * If the player is adjacent to the monster, sites adjacent to the player are not
      valid; you have to 'jump over' the monster in this case.
    * Player can't jump if exhausted or standing in water/lava/liquefied ground
    * Exhaustion duration is set after jump (regardless of success) to prevent a
      second jump, with a duration formula that's the same as the breath duration.
    * The usual melee checks wielded weapon/friendly etc. checks are performed for
      the jump melee.
    * If any of the valid landing sites would cause problems with self-electrocution
      or sanctuary violation, the player is warned first.
    * Range is determined by evocations training; starting attack range is 3
      (movement 2), and it increases by one at evocations 5 and 10.
    * The cost of the jump is 2MP and a hunger cost using the same calculation as
      for flame breath.
    * The delay of a successful jump is the same as melee delay.
    * Fail rate for the ability calculation based on evoke taken from breath fail
      rate code

    Enums for the monster spells/abilities missing tiles.
    
    These turn up in ?/S, and use question marks until we get actual tiles
    for them (fortunately a lot of them are low-hanging targets).
    
    Some spells that were formerly player spells (Berserker Rage, Symbol of
    Torment) still have old tiles; this re-enables those tiles. Also, some
    monster spells duplicate divine abilities, and the enums for those point
    at the appropriate invocation icons.

    A new throwing missile, tentantively named "tomahawk".
    
    The name is somewhat problematic, as real tomahawks were fit for melee
    (just like hand axes...).  It's mostly because a few bailey_axe vaults
    want something that resembles an axe, but I'd rather axe or redesign
    those vaults than have them block better alternatives.
    
    The balance purpose is to have something between darts (damage 2) and
    javelins (damage 10), for use by orcs, orc warriors and merfolk.

    Remove gas traps.
    
    They spawned only randomly (never inside designed vaults), and required lua
    part is already gone.
    
    They were actually the best among mechanical traps, making them least
    deserving of getting axed -- but then, they don't fit in ZotDef.

    Let rltiles work with SDL2.
    
    (Makefile changes not included for now.)
    
    For android, we currently use a modified copy of a random alpha version of
    SDL trunk, which needs a separate code path.  I have no such toolchain to
    test; if it identifies itself as 2.0 rather than 1.3 then we have a problem.
    
    Note that this is merely the "rltiles" tool rather than Crawl itself;
    the latter seems to require quite significant porting.  The two next
    commits are but a start of that task.

    Remove Deep Elf Soldiers (plus band/vault adjustments)
    
    Stat-wise, these were virtually identical to orc wizards in every
    way (except for somewhat better equipment), very weak for the branch
    they appeared in, and simply a plain worse version of another common
    (and not-so-scary) monster already in that same branch.
    
    Vault-wise, most uses of soldiers have been replaced with fighters.
    Sometimes the total number of them was decreased a little, and in one
    case a very early vault was shifted deeper, though most cases seem
    like they could handle an outright buff without much of consequence
    changing.
    
    The contents of the deep elf bands that used them has been altered
    somewhat. Fighter and knight bands are somewhat smaller, with fighters
    taking up the largest part of the slack for the missing soldiers, but
    there is also an increased presence of (improved) mages, along with a
    few other tweaks. On the whole, there should be somewhat fewer elves
    together, but the ones that are present should be more notable.

    Let stone wall tiles vary by console colour.
    
    It might not be the best idea to be varying stone wall colours to begin
    with, but at the very least doing this will help us identify vaults that
    need changing.

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Eradicate laboratory rats.
    
    Unlike st_'s purge which removed harmless renames because they had no
    C++-side code, these are bad precisely because they have C++ side code,
    and lots of it -- with a custom structure that's worse than if each of
    10 labrat flavours had a separate mon-data entry, and none have a special
    ability to show for it.
    
    A rename costs a description and perhaps a tile, there's no maintenance
    burden.

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    Basic tiles for two of the forest monsters.
    
    Specifically, spriggan enchanters (based on the base spriggan and the
    air mage) and tengu reavers (based on the "tengu skald" tile with some
    cues taken from orc knights).
    
    These aren't *too* terrible, I hope.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, and Sojobo needing tiles.

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    Display a different overlay when player or monster held by a web
    
    For now it's a semi-transparent version of a normal web. It
    doesn't look perfect but a fully-opaque version almost completely
    masked the image underneath. Should perhaps get a new image for
    this, with thinner strands and no or thinner outline.
    
    player_caught_in_net no longer calls redraw_screen - otherwise
    there would be a glimpse of a web over the player before the
    item on the ground both existed and was set as "stationary" to
    mark it as the trapping net (for thrown nets). The screen
    seems to get redrawn shortly after anyway.

    Alpha is applied after all other recolour filters. It multiples the alpha
    channel of the image by a given value in the range [1..255]. 0 is not
    allowed as this would just make the image fully transparent. 127 is 50%
    transparency, 255 is equivalent to no change.
    
    The syntax is: %alpha [value]

    Restore goddamned_bats.
    
    Not because it's the best vault, but because it's a prominent reference
    to a part of Crawl's history.  It has none of stated problems: corpses
    work well, there are no "comes into view" problems (because of the genus
    being correct).
    
    This vault's removal has attracted a surprising amount of criticism, mostly
    for emotional reasons, and not a single voice of approval.
    
    I do agree some parts are silly, though: fruity bats and dwarf mountain bats
    are ones I personally wouldn't shed a tear after.

    Djinn: trim the tile's head to human standards.
    
    I used demonspawn tile as the base, assuming it's just recoloured human with
    hooves -- turns out the head is shaped differently, working badly with hair.
    Djinn probably should have dedicated hair styles, but hey, tile folks can
    provide more input than me.
    
    A "female" variant would be nice, too -- I thought they differ only by faint
    boob marks, but it looks like the shape of arms and shoulders is strongly
    distinct.  But again, someone who actually plays tiles will be able to say
    more.

    This is probably not the usual cause of such problems in WebTiles,
    though:
    
    * This doesn't usually happen on servers except when
      manually-triggered rebuilds result in the same branch being built
      twice in a row AND a PNG has been resized.
    
    * This problem won't go away on reloading the page, since the
      coordinates won't be up-to-date in *any* file.

    Add a Red/Blue jester cap tile
    
    Gosh. Adding tiles seems to require a lot of book keeping. Adding only the image for now.

    Axe rock trolls.
    
    They were insufficiently distinguished from their brethren, particularly
    the single deep trolls which replace them.
    
    This also replaces randomly generated rock trolls with single deep trolls.
    Deep troll bands are now generated by specifying one of the
    professionals, which come with bands; thus a deep troll band is going to
    have at least one professional.

    Deep troll earth mages and shamans.
    
    In deep troll bands, one in three deep trolls will be assigned one of
    those classes randomly.
    
    Shamans haste/might others.
    
    Earth mages use LRD and dig.
    
    The new monsters come with tiles (by ontoclasm) and descriptions.
    
    The berserker is going unused for now, as it is not as interesting
    compared to the other designs.

    Merge branch 'bad_forms'
    
    It's not 100% ready, but should be functional enough, and 0.12 coming soon,
    let's test it at least a bit.  The numbers are probably totally out of
    whack, but that's what trunk players are for.  At least the code should be
    sound.
    
    This does include the jelly form that I'm strongly inclined to remove, yet
    it's easy to axe without affecting save compat (as no player can be in that
    form currently).  All the code can be found by grepping for TRAN_JELLY,
    except for one commit that's not bad to have (some refactoring of eating).
    Generally, the jelly suffers from being abusable for nutrition, would need
    some code for item [non-]use, and would make the player screwed as it can
    neither take/deal damage (tree), avoid it (wisp) or run away (wisp, pig,
    bat, porcupine).

    Rename arcane familiar to battlesphere.
    
    The word "familiar" suggests a summon rather than a magical construct; this
    spell is much more like Conjure Ball Lightning than Call Canine Familiar.
    
    Since the suggestion "battlesphere" has met with great approval (or at
    least nobody has come up with better), let's use that.

    Link monster tiles for bad forms, add a too-ugly-to-live tree form one.
    
    The code for equipment-using form tiles is not fit for the task, so I used
    a hack using regular player doll code instead.  It draws the weapon behind
    the tile instead of the front (and can't be easily fixed), and fails to draw
    shields at all.

    Rename worn shield tiles according to their names; move unused to doll_only/
    
    The latter are not 100% unused -- they can be used with the doll editor (-)
    in local tiles.  That's something 0.01% of players know about, and those who
    do probably played with it once.
    
    In other words, all these shield tiles are currently wasted.  They're not
    used for glowing/racial variants, nor even for randarts.

    Fix Donald and Louise being drawn with a shield when they have none.
    
    This separates their shield from the base tile, and allows them to show
    randarts if they happen to be generated with one (both are eligible).
    
    This does _not_ fix Louise's shield looking like a buckler when worn:
    she has a large shield whenever her weapon is 1-handed, yet the tile is
    too small.

    Remove some problematic vaults.
    
    The snail statues give XP for tediously killing a defenseless monster, stop
    autoexplore, introduce exclusions, etc.  And a tiresome slog through mud goes
    against "take it easy".  The vault has been disabled for quite a while and
    no one suggested how to fix it.
    
    People randomly combusting for no explainable reason are no good, either --
    altars with a caged sacrifice waiting for a worthy adventurer can be somehow
    argued for, this series of vaults not really.  Especially if people who die
    there can't live in that branch in the first place.
    
    Two piles of human chunks with wands of disintegration with exactly 0 charges
    can't be realistically explained as a "duel", either.  It's too silly a
    gimmick -- silliness should at least have some reason.

    white_noise's update to his Arachne's tile, also a staveless version.
    
    The latter is used only as a base for the corpse, as both items she is
    allowed to wield (staff of poison and the Staff of Olgreb) fit the
    hard-drawn versions.  Technically, ordinary staves of poison might be
    something else than a stick with a green ball at an end, but blah.
    
    This is a slightly deboobified version compared to his submission,
    my apologies to connoiseurs.  Sorry guys (and at least one lady)!

    Add roctavian's dryad and leshy tiles to UNUSED/
    
    They'd be forgotten otherwise.  There are currently no good plans how to fix
    the Forest monster set (they proved to be inadequate: damn hard vs melee and
    targetted spells, falling like flies to any effects that ignore EV).  While
    we'd need some ACy monsters, dryads and leshys can have medium AC if we'd
    stretch the theme slightly for bark-like skin, and both have a strong
    affinity to trees (animating trees? transforming into one?), so it's not
    unlikely the tiles will end up used after all.

    Webtiles: Do animations on the client and, optionally, in real-time.
    
    Real-time animations are just an experiment and have to be enabled in
    the F10 dialog, but this has an advantage even if I choose to remove
    them: It prevents a lot of unnecessary tile updates (and thus
    bandwidth), especially in places with a lot of water or lava.
    
    Real-time animated torches, altars and wizlab portals look good;
    dungeon water and lava doesn't look too bad, but is annoying; and
    shoals water is very bad.

    Android port.
    
    2 files are added to the root of the repository:
    * AndroidAppSettings.cfg: settings file required for Android SDL port. Will
      change on each minor release to reset configuration.
    * AndroidBuild.sh: script called by the Android SDL port to commence building
      the game itself
    
    It might be nice to be able to move them elsewhere, but for now, their
    presence here is required.
    
    The build process is documented in docs/develop/android.txt
    
    There's a TOUCH_UI compiler flag which sets all the things specific to a
    touch screen interface.
    
    There has been a large amount of changes in the Makefile for redefining where
    the dat/, saves/, etc. directories go, because the "install" part of the make
    isn't the final destination for these files under Android - the environment we
    deploy to is a separate device from the build environment.
    
    There is also a number of changes to the tiles interface. Some are specific
    to the TOUCH_UI, but others are also changed in USE_TILE_LOCAL.
    
    Touch only:
    * 'a'bilities menu goes straight to menu without prompting first
    * tap menu header to toggle/submit
    * menu instead of prompt to select which corpse to butcher
    * same for eating food from the floor (those 2 could go in local tiles too)
    * show_more defaults to false and less --more-- messages
    * pickup mode defaults to menu
    * defaults for tile_layout_priority is different (commands are more
      important than inventory)
    * popup for yes/no prompts, level-up stat gain and swapping rings (should
      be used for all prompts, and probably local tiles too)
    * spell casting: force selection menu
    * map mode: left-click rather than right-click for mouse mode; autotravel on
      left-click removed
    * remove skills training and memorisation panels
    
    Also local tiles (some could also be integrated in webtiles):
    * commands below description are clickable
    * clickable shopping menu (uses PrecisionMenu)
    * split the command panel in 2 (common actions and system commands)
    * add a map command panel
    * tapping or left-clicking the player is smarter:
      * picks up the item if there's one on the tile, otherwise
      * shows pick-up menu if there's several items on the tile, otherwise
      * traverses stairs (or enters a portal or shop) if one is present, otherwise
      * prays if an altar is present, otherwise
      * waits one turn
    * right-clicking the map enters map mode and brings the map commands tab to
      the front; map mode stays until exited rather than upon release of mouse
    
    Some more details can be found in android_patch_notes.txt on #5677 (although
    some TODOs are already obsolete).

    which are still the most likely variant, although their subvariants have
    smaller effective weights than "relief", "undead" and this new "abyss".

    Perhaps it should be used for tiles that are likely to be ever reused only?
    We could also have a separate repository just for such files, also adding
    source .XCFs and so on.

    Mephitic, poison and miasma clouds from a level 2 spell just isn't

    in practice, and miasma is absurdly strong even with decay corpses
    being rarer.

              uselessness (harmful/useless scrolls);
    - Tan:    amnesia, identify, magic mapping, remove curse (utility
              spells);
    - Teal:   acquirement (it deserves a colour of its own on account of its
              importance, and teal matches the standard text colour);
    - Brown:  unholy creation (doesn't really fit into any of the above, and
              there was a colour left).
    
    Unknown scrolls have no ribbons.

    This adds in two new feature types, DNGN_UNKNOWN_ALTAR and
    DNGN_UNKNOWN_PORTAL, to which these tiles are assigned; the magic
    mapping code returns these two features for unknown altars and portals
    respectively.

    Recompress source tiles with significant waste.
    
    There's been a while since the last such run.  It's questionable if such
    runs should be done at all, as git will carry both old and new versions (not
    knowing it's not a real change) so only source tarballs see an improvement.

    Allow specification of only one of image or code handling in tilegen.
    
    This allows the image and the code to be built independently; thus their
    dependencies can be (and now are) checked separately, preventing code
    from being rebuilt when only tile images have been updated (as opposed
    to the dc-*.txt definitions of the images, which are a dependency for
    both the image ant the code).

    Prevent spurious tile file rebuilds.
    
    The time stamps of rltiles/tiledef-* and rltiltes/tileinfo-* weren't
    being updated due to the code refusing to overwrite the files if they
    hadn't changed; this was confusing the Makefile into attempting to
    regenerate the tiles even if they didn't need to be regenerated. The
    code now unconditionally overwrites the files when they needed to be
    generated.
    
    This also fixes an issue where the dependency files for the images was
    incorrect when doing a non-tiles build - the wrong path for some images
    was not turning up on account of not checking to see if the provided
    file name existed. This has been addressed. (I suspect that this was the
    root cause of the issue that originally motivated the introduction of
    checking to see if the file needing to be overwritten.)
    
    Some now-needless functionality related to the above has been removed;
    if it's needed again in the future, it can be pulled from the revision
    history.
    
    This partially reverts commit 5d812b3a48325e4c98a24bd036cba34cb9c9747f.

    Even if the code can (usually) deal with smaller sizes, it's still unobvious
    which way they get aligned.
    
    There's a worse case: rltiles/dngn/wall/icy_stone{0,1,2,3}.png are 32x33,
    spilling over the next tile.  This seems to work but may break some corner
    cases (like, redraw order).

    A L2 spell that lets you get the rune from Tomb:3 without seeing a single

    the rest of the time) and I don't see much hope of balancing it.

    if testing shows problems, we can disable lightning and at least not have to

    Re-add the tile for bog bodies.
    
    The last commit removed instead of renaming it.

    Rename bog mummies to bog bodies.
    
    Without the death curses, calling them mummies (and putting them on 'M') is
    confusing. "Bog body" is good name for this monster (it's synonymous with
    bog mummy). I've put it on 'z' and made it lightgreen. They've also been
    removed from one ossuary.
    
    Thanks to |amethyst for suggesting this change.

    a renaming is warranted.

    liked both, so I put the blue one into UNUSED.

    All vaults use it with the meaning of "orc", too (or in a commented out use
    in pan_disco_hall, for its colour).

    Axe wax.
    
    It is used only in a few vaults, and where it does, it only confuses players
    about which sources of fire can melt it and which can't.  The last problem
    applies to trees as well, but at least it's somewhat more intuitive there.

    Rod of lightning.
    
    [Unfinished: no actual damage yet.]
    
    A single zap uses only two mana, evoking it in subsequent turns will take 5
    (or less if the rod is spent), spreading the damage upon the whole arc
    between, with a boost if you're not aiming at the same place.  Releasing
    the trigger (ie, doing any action other than evoking the rod) will stop
    the discharge.

    Fix the animation of the chei altar tile.
    
    This was practically unnoticeable, but the tile was chosen at random
    instead of sequentially, as intended.
    
    Also, for whatever reason, the tiles were listed in reverse order, so
    the clock still ran backwards with the fix. I changed that, but maybe
    it was intended?

    Axe axe traps.
    
    When trying to make a description for them, I realized they don't make any
    sense.  Hand axes are fit for throwing by hand, but terrible for launching
    via a spring/etc.  And simply dropping the axe from the ceiling doesn't
    match the message, and there are better things to hang.
    
    We got too many mechanical traps already.

    Make staves and rods separate object classes.
    
    They have about no overlap, more than both being usable as weapons.  A vast
    majority of uses immediately checked item_is_rod()/item_is_staff().
    
    I kept them shared for acquirement, for now.
    
    Also, eliminate rods of smiting -- hardly ever used, problematic theme-wise
    as they use "divine providence" without worship.  Keeping rods of striking
    for now, could be used to fix artificer problems.  Adding/removing rod enums
    is a mess due to tile handling, renaming ROD_SMITING to ROD_LIGHTNING for now.

    Remove scrolls of detect curse.
    
    These scrolls simultaneously encouraged scummy behavior (collecting dozens of
    weapons/armour to detect curses on all of them at once) and were pretty much
    junk after early game (because remove curse is common and you probably don't
    actually want to try out every weapon in the game because of distortion
    anyway).
    
    I tried to change other scroll generation probabilities as little as possible,
    but this means something like a 3-5% increase for most scrolls, and about 15%
    for remove curse (as very partial compensation). The scroll generation code is
    a bit cleaner now.
    
    Upgraded games have detect curse converted to remove curse.

    A way to check which tiles are not included in the textures.
    
    A tile can be unused in two ways:
    1. it is not loaded from .png files (and gets no enum)
    2. it has an enum but is not referenced anywhere else
    
    This allows checking 1.

    Fix non-tile builds with gcc-4.7.
    
    Apparently, "new some_class_type[0]" returns a null iff some_class_type has
    any constructor.  This changed since gcc-4.6, and apparently contradicts the
    C++ standard 3.7.4.1 which explicitely requests new() to always return
    non-NULL even on 0-byte allocations, but then, C++ doesn't allow zero-length
    arrays.  What's the point of 3.7.4.1 then?  Could someone explain?
    
    Regardless of whether it's an error in gcc or in my understanding of the
    standard, there are compiler versions in the wild that don't accept this
    code, so I made it allocate a dummy length 1 array instead.

    A spider with IOOD and the new M_MAINTAIN_RANGE flag.  Does not spawn
    randomly currently; has a vault on Spider:4-5 (default weight) for

    toned down with more cantrip slots.
    
    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    Reverting the removal is easy...
    
    Also, not everything can be #ifdefed which leads to coordination problems with

    example, you could have subtractor snakes spawn in Zot right until this commit

    Remove Terpsichore (remember, you can revert!).
    
    She's no good, and no one came with a reasonable plan to repair her.
    
    Her signature spell can be trivially avoided by leading her away and/or
    apporting, saccing or even merely picking up the weapons -- so she's either
    a pushover if you're spoiled, or very deadly if you're uninformed enough to
    fight her near a pile of big weapons.
    
    The only semi-ok idea so far is to have her summon weapons from the
    Hammerspace, and this loses all coolness of the Tukima's Ball idea.  If
    someone has a better plan after all, you know what to do.

    Fix #5133: secret door positions revealed next to walls with redefined tiles.
    
    This was a regression from my tilepick.cc changes. Since the tile
    picking code now operates on map_knowledge, it didn't know about the
    undetected secret door and thus didn't use the tile override from
    adjacent tiles.
    
    This is a bit of a problem with tile_flv, which on the one hand is
    player-accessible (parts of it get transmitted to the webtiles client,
    for example), but on the other hand could contain "secret" data, like
    in this case (maybe the only one at the moment). (Note that this
    "secret" data didn't actually get sent to the client, but it could
    easily have been if more tile picking logic was on the client side.)
    
    I've opted to fix up tile_flv directly in tile_init_flavour, so that
    secret doors take the tile override of their neighbours. Of course,
    that causes the problem that the tile override is still there when the
    secret door gets turned into an open door, which resulted in an
    assert ("non-door tile").
    
    That's why now, only certain tiles are allowed as door overrides; all
    others simply do nothing for doors since they are assumed have been
    set for undetected secret doors. It also means that you can either
    override the appearance of an undetected secret door, or its
    appearance after detection, but not both. I don't think that was done
    anywhere, but if it was, a more complicated solution might be
    necessary.

    Avoid spurious regeneration of tiledef headers.
    
    tilegen had a bug causing it to think that small (< 1024 byte) files had
    changed when they had not.  This resulted in tiledef-dngn.h (and thus
    the source files that depended on that) being regenerated even when
    nothing had changed.  Whether the bug triggers depends on uninitialised
    memory contents, so might or might not have shown up in a given run.

    Rename Kenku -> Tengu.
    
    "Kenku" itself seems to be a name and a concept specifically from D&D.
    Our kenku (now tengu) were alike these in that they were quite weak
    ("glass canon" about sums it up), but ours can fly, and D&D kenku
    cannot.
    
    This is really only the first step in properly differentiating then. D&D
    kenku are based on the Japanese folk creature of the tengu, so it seems
    sane to return to the roots; this is where NetHack tengu come from.
    
    Should retain save compatability. There might be a possible issue with
    the renamed tiles, but the order of the tiles file hasn't changed at
    all, so presumably these will be safe.

    A new (tiles) look for Tartarus (Denzi).
    
    It's much darker, and greener than before. The only problem is metal stands
    out a bit too much... I've made it use a dark metal tile in tartarus, but
    it's still grey instead of greenish like everything else. Luckily metal is
    rare in tar.
    
    Also, I made some small comestic adjustments to tomb, so the "wall of
    skulls" still has a place in crawl. It's most obvious on tomb:1.

    Several redone tiles and adjusted tiles from roctavian (#4805).
    
    Total redesigns: Asmodeus, Dispater, Ereshkigal, Hell Knight, Necromancer, Wizard. (The lords will actually soon be replaced by 32x48 designs.)
    
    The rest get a hand-drawn border, and some other (mostly minor) adjustments.

    Rename "plate mail" to "plate armour".
    
    Not sure about the name, "full plate" might sound better.
    
    I wonder how no one else was annoyed by having three pieces of armour being
    synonyms of each other.
    
    Also, our tiles show solid plate rather than mail.

    Rename "crystal plate mail" to "crystal plate".
    
    It makes no sense to make MAIL from crystal -- thin plates made of a
    material that is on the brittle side would break in no time, and piercing
    them to insert combining rings would chip it out quickly as the rings move
    somewhat during use.
    
    Making plate ARMOUR on the other hand is reasonable assuming you have proper
    crystal.  (Yeah, yeah, "crystal" in the popular meaning, I know how most
    solids look on the molecular level :p)
    
    The tiles show plate armour rather than plate mail, too.

    Improve medium armour, remove banded mails.
    
    Ring, scale, chain get +1 base AC.
    
    So do steam and mottled dragons -- no one ever uses them as +2 AC is not
    worth having no brand.
    
    "Banded mail" is a D&D invention, and is mostly synonymous with splint.
    Even our code merged them in some cases -- like, tiles display.

    Fix wrong colour key handling in the rltile tool (#4824).
    
    It assumed all paletted images used colour keys; when they didn't, the
    first palette entry would be transparent. Since that was mostly the
    darkest colour, this wasn't very noticeable, but still yielded some
    artifacts for tinted floor tiles, for examples.

    Rename dragon armour to "fire dragon armour".  Just the item, not monster.
    
    There's a lot of confusion among players who mistake other dragon armours
    for it.  On the other hand, no variant like "common dragon", "fire dragon",
    etc sounds good, "red dragon" would be D&Dism[1] and would require redoing
    tiles and being contrary to pre-D&D stories, etc.  Like every single
    medieval legend has dragons breathing fire and nothing else[2], thus
    "dragon" without an adjective is damn clear what it means -- kind like
    "chair" vs "electric chair".  Also, "The fire dragon breathes fire at you."
    sounds awfully redundant.
    
    Thus, after several long IRC discussions, let's try this way.
    
    [1]. Draconians are a pure Dragonlance/Krynn D&Dism, but so far we have all
    draconians color-coded and no dragon use colour names, let's keep that.
    [2]. Some related creatures breathe poison.  Nothing before D&D does cold,
    electricity, acid, etc.

    Remove vipers
    
    They're barely differentiated from water moccasins and black mambas,
    as well as only even spawning in the Snake Pit where they're just yet
    another poisoning monster.
    
    For Sticks to Snakes, I gave it an extra chance of upgrading to a water
    moccasin at 40 power, instead of to a viper.

    Finish the removal of katanas.
    
    This is mostly clean-up of dormant code, as the only way to get a katana is
    Bloodbane.  Funny thing is, it wasn't even converted to a katana properly in
    cfbf888d -- its tiles show an european style sword.  To preserve the
    intended upgrade I made it a demon blade, but this means the tiles should
    probably get that violet aura other demon stuff has.  Not doing that yet
    since there might be issues with good god worshippers -- theme of Bloodbane
    doesn't exactly scream "a good or neutral item" to me but you might
    disagree.
    
    There is a remnant left -- tile of level 21..25 Long Blade ghosts, no other
    sword seems to fit well.

    It's hard enough to get an idea of damage done from wound descriptions, no
    need to make it harder with a misleading scale.

    Show halo radius in tiles.
    
    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed
    monsters) becomes packed_cell.halo, with either HALO_NONE, HALO_RANGE
    or HALO_MONSTER as value.
    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    A vault showcasing tornado rotation.  The only way in is to let yourself get carried away.
    
    This implementation isn't that good, though.  A single scroll of blinking and a means of
    teleportation mean you can get the reward taking just one turn of damage.  I tried making
    a whole tornado alley but I guess some people are better at vault making at me.  Another
    idea would be a system (at least a loop) of tight corridors, damage is proportional to
    obelisk hd so reduction is not an issue.

    Rename "beast" to "hell beast".
    
    We need monsters named "monster", "insect", "mammal", or "creature".
    Unlike, say, "human" which is about as specific as "orc" or "yaktaur", or
    "dragon" which refers to the ordinary species (like "bat" vs "fire bat"),
    the name "beast" doesn't say anything about the monster.
    
    The new name might be not the best choice, if you have a better idea, please
    say so.

    panels. Though most letters fit into 7x12 or lower, all tiles have
    the same dimension of 8x13. As part of the rltiles set, they are
    public domain.
    
    Currently unused, but I'll try to add the necessary code in the
    next couple of days. 0.9 target, obviously.

    Some more (improved) tiles of Denzi's.
    
    New tiles for Leda's Liquefaction, the chardump command and the arena
    icon.
    
    Denzi's alternative air elemental tile has been moved into the UNUSED
    directory and codenamed "spirit". Could be used for some water-based
    undead creature or something along those lines.

    Temporary tile for holy flames.
    
    This is just a recoloured grey smoke tile, which is now yellow to match
    the similar colour in ASCII. It doesn't look anything like flames,
    though -- but I don't think actually using flames would be a good idea.

    While I find them pretty cool, the author is unable to modify them to use
    the new title logo because he lost the source files. He also doesn't like
    them as much as Denzi's ones (style is quite different indeed).
    Put them under unused, so we can bring them back if someone can edit them
    with the new title logo.

    A testing vault for new holies.
    
    They appear to be in a pretty bad shape so some testing is needed before
    release.  They tend to Pan lord hard so I placed the vault on D:26, and
    because we're going to freeze soon, it is guaranteed for now.
    
    The 1/4 chance for a PDA might screw up the balance of other stuff somewhat,
    but for a week or so, we'll survive.

    The latter still requires a nice humanoid-shaped statue tile; centaur
    and naga statues are now displayed with their wielded weapon.
    
    Also, I accidentally optimized the already existing statue tiles
    (used *.png because I was sure I'd already done that when checking
    them in the first time around). I don't think it's a big enough deal
    for me to bother with checking them out again to override this change.

    Plain bats, for redefining and for player form.
    
    Chunks are currently not affected by redefinitions.  I considered making
    n_spe affect them, however, deep elves create "chunk of elf flesh", we
    don't want "black sheep" to produce "black sheep" chunks, and so on.
    Thus, for consistency, let's have fancy bats produce "bat" flesh.
    
    For players, the bat form is referred to as "bat" not "megabat", and thus
    people don't expect they have to write the latter when redefining.  This
    is used for non-vampires (Xom, Metamorphosis, Flight), of these, only the
    last card is a common occurence.

    Recompress files with a waste ratio 3 or bigger.
    
    This is a net loss for git checkouts (which keep both the old and new
    versions, even though the real contents haven't changed), and reduces only
    working dirs and tarballs which don't really matter -- but come on, having
    files like beards that are 96% junk is ridiculous.  Thus I recompressed only
    the most egregious cases, reducing 3.9MB to 3.6.  A full recompression would
    take it down to 2.5MB.

    Rename giant mosquito -> vampire mosquito; remove giant blowfly.
    
    It's actually remove giant mosquito and rename blowfly to vampire
    mosquito, because that's literally what I did. However, the resulting
    effect is that mosquitoes have now had quite a buff, and blowflies are
    now gone.
    
    This hopefully keeps save compatability by transmuting any giant
    blowfies into vampire mosquitoes. This will cause issue with attacks,
    colour, etc, but these are transitory and will only last the minor
    version.

    I renamed the old lair tiles to floor_moss, but was too tired
    to go through the (small number of) minivaults that make use
    of it.

    Giant beetle -> goliath beetle. (coolio)
    
    Again, another "giant" monster that seems to only have "giant" in the
    name to make it sound more scary. In this instance, "goliath" is an
    excellent synonym. Suggested by coolio also on the forum -- I think.
    
    Also, they are real beetles!

    Giant ants -> worker ants (coolio, Kekitalo).
    
    Yet another monster that uses "giant" as a modifier. Renaming them to
    "worker ant" puts them further in line with our hierarchy of ant-based
    monsters: queen ant, soldier ant, worker ant.

    Giant bats are now megabats.
    
    Yup, a pretty extreme change. Reasoning: "giant X" is boring. Just
    because it's giant doesn't mean that it's somehow more threatening. We
    could comfortably leave them as "bats" but I think "megabat" is better:
    it's not a word people hear often, and it conjures up largeness and
    slightly more of a threat than you might initially think.
    
    It's also the proper name for bats, so where could we go wrong?

    After several attempts to balance it, it was always either overpowered or
    useless.  No wonders, we have such diverse races as kobolds, orcs, merfolk,
    mummies and draconians -- it's hard to come up with a formula that matches
    monsters of that races well.
    
    There's a minor save breakage: brooch of Shielding, robe of Clouds and hat
    of Pondering have their descriptions shifted by one, the hat of Pondering
    causes rain clouds.  We don't have any ifdefs for art-data.txt, the breakage
    is small enough I didn't bother with shims.

    Coolio's sergeant and shaman tiles for gnoll camp. Also tweak sergeants.
    
    Sergeants now always get a good spear and a buckler or a shield, also boosted their HD up to 4. I did the changes based on the tile, and the fact that vault-only tiles don't seem to be able to show the wielded items dynamically. I already requested Coolio for yet another sergeant tile tweak - adding a fixed spear.

    Pearl dragons now leave pearl dragon armour.
    
    The tiles are merely temporary recolourings of the gold dragon armour
    tile: they are scale-like, but are now sort of pale yellow/white gold
    colour as opposed to the yellow of gold dragon armour.
    
    They will never generate cursed.
    
    Current stats are: AC 10, EV -2, rN+.
    
    Yes, it's pretty powerful: it's also as rare as gold dragon armour, and
    pearl dragons are currently even rarer than gold dragons (ie, they do
    not actually generate). However, rarity does not balance automatically,
    and these values may be subject to change at a later date.
    
    Hopefully save compat is maintained!

    Add the necessary enums, etc, for Homunculus spell.
    
    Tiles required (will go on Wiki):
    
    * Homunculus monster (Google images represents these as small creatures
      with large hands and large heads. I'd prefer we didn't go with this
      but instead have a "miniature" creature, like a very small goblin.
      Homunculi will be on the 'g' glyph and lightcyan.)
    * Soupling monster (A "lump" homunculus in white or lightgrey)
    * Homunculus spell tile (A smaller version of the homunculus sitting
      inside a flask; could be similar to the evaporation spell tile, but
      without the "broken" pieces of glass nearby).
    * "Fizzing potion" item overlay. (A small series of bubbles could work;
      The idea in my head is for an ellipse (shortcut for a "perspective"
      circle) with "fizzing" bubbles above it, or possible lines to denote
      the bubbles if bubbles are too small to work with. I'm reminded of a
      spell from Chrono Trigger, but can't remember the tech name nor find
      an image of it for demonstration).
    
    Just storing this now so when I start work on it, I don't need to wait
    for all the enums to compile. Yay enums!

    Rename holy dragon to pearl dragon (OG17).
    
    "Pearl" has some interesting religious connotations and it sounds
    infinitely better than "holy dragon". The latter is much like <a randomly
    generate adjective> + "dragon", whereas the former sounds different and
    has thought put into it.
    
    Thanks, OG17!

    Steal the inappropriate air elemental tile for twisters.
    
    It's a recoloured vortex rather than an elemental (cf. all other elemental
    tiles we have -- quasi-humanoids), so it should be used for what is an air
    vortex.
    
    Also, it is same as the spell tile for Tornado, and air elementals have
    nothing to do with it -- unlike twisters which are "unattached" tornados
    (technically, a token monster that serves merely as a graphic for the
    tornado's stem).

    tiles in the main dungeon because, as usual, all wall tiles get
    shifted around because of this. :(

    New unique: Jory, in the Tower of Silence; new monster enums.
    
    Will only appear in the currently-unfinished (and therefore, not yet
    committed) Tower of Silence vault. Concept by Greensnark and dpeg! Has a
    tile! Bonus fun death effect: he explodes in a cloud of all the blood he
    ever drank! Might be a bit over the top.
    
    Tile could do with being seriously improved.
    
    Also adds enums for the new Abyssal horrors: I was getting sick and
    tired of stashing them every time I need to make a commit.

    Add new skill tab tile, use old one for commands.

    Add coolio's fire crab tile.
    
    It looks more "crablike" than the current one, which somewhat
    resembles a small spider.

    For this purpose, I merged two of psyshvl's eldritch tentacles.

    Add a zombified kraken head tile.
    
    Using the normal tentacles looks okay, so zombifying those is not
    at all urgent. (That, and I fear the code duplication necessary
    for them.)

    New tiles: porcupine, fire crab. (Malwyn)
    
    Added to credits. Added Curio to credits, also.
    
    Porcupines exist as monsters but haven't actually been defined yet.
    They'll probably replace <some> rats as a singular, slightly more
    difficult opponent that have spikey quills, etc.

    New monster: raven.
    
    A blue 'b' monster, it eats corpses, pecks and claws at you, and doesn't
    generate anywhere in the dungeon. It's specifically designed for a
    forthcoming vault ("Tower of Silence"). I'm not really sure where it
    would be interesting to generate, but feel free to add it to a specific
    branch.
    
    Includes a tile: the raven.bmp from the NetHack rltiles (from
    rltiles.sourceforge.net). I've tweaked it by adding a border.

    Currently un-detached, and without command tiles.
    (I used one of Denzi's minitiles as a placeholder
    for the tab itself.)

    Different sky beast tile: quetzalcoatl-like monster.
    
    This is based on the coatl tile from the NetHack rltiles, with a black
    border and some elctricity added. I'm not 100% happy with it: it should
    perhaps be slightly transparent, and more "cloud-like". In this instance
    the previous tile was possibly better, but I still prefer this over the
    old one.

    Use Curio's bog mummy (with moss) tile!
    
    I've actually darkened it considerably to better match the leathery skin
    of an actual bog mummy. The sphagnum moss growing on it is a thousand
    times awesome.

    Use coolio's 4-pointed silver star tile. (#2763)
    
    I personally like that it's a four-pointed star, but some people
    raised concerns about it on mantis. I'm not sure what their concerns
    about it being a four-pointed star was, though; at the very least, it is
    better than no tile.

    Add and use psyshvl's tentacle overlay tiles.
    
    I've added them via background flags, which seems odd at first, but
    works rather well.
    
    Krakens look much better now, though the angles still seem a bit
    sharp sometimes and would benefit from further tweaking.

    The may_stab_brand is shifted to the question mark (old stab_brand),
    and the exclamation mark (old may_stab_brand) is currently unused.
    
    More Zzz variants can be found in the UNUSED directory.

    Add purge's wall tiles (curr. vault-only) and new dagger tile.
    
    I've been meaning to add the wall tiles for a while now, but I
    now feel that they both of these are too special to just crop up

    Anyway, at least the skeleton one might be useful to vault
    designers.

    No idea if the Stonesoup tornado actually works like that, but at
    least it replaces the question mark tile in the books.

    Add cloud with disturbance tiles for invisible monsters in cloud.
    
    This fix Mantis 2573.
    
    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.

    Make the iron grate an actual feature rather than a Lua redefinition.
    
    The only differences are that it shows as '#' even with CSET_IBM (unless
    redefined), and that it's easier to use dynamically as it doesn't need
    markers anymore.

    Implement snail/turtle shells, rename giant snails -> agate snails.
    
    Agate snails are another name for the Giant African Snail, the largest
    land snail ever. It, in my opinion, sounds a lot better than just plain
    old boring "giant snail", and as most people don't know what an agate
    snail is, we can take advantage of it.
    
    Turtles (alligator snapping and plain snapping) as well as agate snails
    will now withdraw into their shells as an "escape spell" (implemented
    using the same hp<mhp/4 logic as escape spells, but actually a special
    ability rather than a spell). Being "withdrawn" grants them an extra
    10AC as well as regen (not specifically stated, should perhaps be?),
    causes them to become stationary and cease attacking.
    
    Commit also introduces ENCH_ATTACHED and MB_ATTACHED (enum.h and
    mon-info.h respectively) for attached leeches, not yet coded.

    Now:
    	* Prompts before entering, no longer tries to enter while

    	* Has a cool description!
    	* Has a relatively cool tile!
    	* No longer causes a beam.cc assert with feat_is_solid.
    
    May have issues with monsters, lookin at that now.
