    Remove special cloud disturbance tiles.
    
    The unseen monster tile was already drawn on top of these, so the change
    shouldn't be noticeable.
    
    Also fixes wrong cloud tile shown with disturbances in some situations
    (#10002). It was caused trying to use disturbance versions for clouds
    that didn't have them.
    
    Basically reverts commit caa5519827a693b714aaff1417e64fc9d533b1d4.

    The crown of Eternal Torment (Siegurt). Needs non-crappy tiles.
    
    Gives rTorment and reduces your maxhp by 35% (i.e., how much torment would
    do, since it also gives rN+++). Made it +3 and SInv for some nice symmetry
    with the other crown. It autocurses 100% of the time, which should help if
    being swappable makes it abusable (though I'm not convinced it would be
    anyway).
    
    Tiles are poorly-photoshopped copies of Dyrovepreva's. I am so, so sorry.

    The orb of Zot was hung between the Zot lungs with defiance and hate
    In hopes that qw wouldn't be late;
    
    Crazy Yiuf was nestled, snug in his bed
    Sigmund was stalking, filling n00bs with dread
    And Cerebov his robe and Lom Lobon in its wrath,
    Had just settled scores over some player's bones.

    New unrand - Gyre and Gimble (argonaut).
    
    This version differs from the original patch in significant ways; in
    fact, gameplay-wise, it's a whole new weapon. Instead of being,
    effectively, a two-hander for short blades (i.e., the best in terms of
    base damage that the class can provide), it's literally two strikes per
    attack. I added vorpal to it because that definitely lowered damage
    versus AC, and, of course, for the Jabberwocky reference.
    
    Tile by roctavian.

    A level 6 Hex/Translocation that pulls creatures towards a targeted

    Appears in the book of the Warp and the book of Hinderance.
    
    "Gell" is intended to be pronounced with a hard G.

    New unique: Robin of the Strong Arm
    
    A very early-game hobgoblin unique (currently at D2-4); about
    twice as tough as a hobgoblin, but placing with a mob of goblin
    & hobgoblin minions, and with the ability to buff them (with
    Battlecry) and hurl them at the player.
    
    As a nice piece of early-game loot, she has a guaranteed
    helmet, like Crazy Yiuf's cloak. Implementation uses the Nikola
    Hack (equipping it in her shield slot), alas.
    
    (The code for goblin tossing is extremely bad and shameful.
    I am sorry.)

    Introducing Ushabti, guardian mummy dilution for Tomb
    
    Guardian mummies, the main fodder in Tomb, are awkward if functional designs.
    Slow, melee-only amassed monsters with a punishing effect for killing them has
    obvious value in countering mass conjurations, but a few will go to great
    lengths to avoid or diminish their effects through, say, luring seperation
    tactics or the previous summoning effect. Some of this is arguably due to
    the psychological damage of statdrain, rot, and lighter draining amounts,
    which, while repairable concepts each and of themselves (plus eventually
    replacable), are also only used in any serious amounts in this branch anyway.
    This suggests an attempt to dilute rather than replace the death curse bombs
    known as guardian mummies.
    
    The ushabti, more light ancient Egyptian lore, are funerary figurines intended
    to serve as workers and servants for the dead in the afterlife. Their
    introduction cuts into the appearance rate of guardian mummies by 2/5s.
    They're non-living, have stats not very far away from guardian mummies but
    with more resists, and provide more flavour / non-demonic non-undead placements
    for extended. While they're still push-overs for when they appear alone,
    especially since they're still slow like guardian mummies, they've got two
    tricks that should make them rather relevant in Tomb:
    
     * Loud shouts, louder than dragon roars (The ushabti rumbles deeply! x6).
       Obviously relevant in the quietness of Tomb, and considering the monster
       use possibly a replacement enough of it.
     * A new spell, "Death Rattle". This breathes a line of randomly-mixed miasma
       and draining clouds, similarly to the petrifying breath of catoblepae.
       They don't cast it too often, though a little more when at low health:
       the movement this suggestions to avoid clouds with effects close to the
       lighter death curses should be a rather interesting incarnation of the
       intent of guardian mummy death curses, considering how often one is pinned
       down in Tomb.

    Tweak short blades
    
    Three changes:
    
    (1) All shortblades are now piercing, not just daggers/qbl. This
    simplifies matters considerably, removes a point of frequent
    confusion (for even surprisingly experienced players!), and is
    probably a buff for weak weapon types, for those lunatics who
    fight hydras with short swords.
    
    (2) Accordingly, the cutlass weapon type has been renamed, to
    'rapier'. The captain's cutlass is now, once again, its own weapon
    type. (It is now the only slicing short blade.)
    
    (3) Short blades' vorpal ego is now called "piercing", not
    "stabbing". Stabbing is a word that has a meaning in crawl, and it
    is not what that ego did! (This was another point of confusion for
    unspoiled players.)

    be kept, with exceptions granted to the smaller pan/hell lord tiles and the
    old orb guardian tile.
    
    If anybody wanted to use any of those tiles, they can find them in the git
    history alongside plenty of other tile replacements that didn't get preserved
    so explicitly.

    Turn rings of regen into amulets
    
    Rings of regen are notorious for encouraging tedious swapping,
    since they're at best marginally useful in combat, and quite
    useful outside combat. The amulet slot has a number of types
    that already discourage swapping (faith, guardian spirit,
    gourmand), which should at least ameliorate the regen problem
    somewhat; and if we later want to change regen to do something
    similar, it'll be a bit more intuitive if it's in the same slot.
    
    This also helps refresh the pool of amulets, which was starting
    to look a little shabby.

    Make mimics cackle & vanish into a puff of smoke!
    
    Mimics historically have served two purposes. They were "the
    absence of the expected", whether that expected thing was an
    item, a branch entrance, a shop, etc; and they were a threat, a
    monster that tried to attack you when you discovered them.
    
    The former worked pretty well. The latter does not. They are
    quite weak, as enemies, and have been ever since constriction
    was nerfed. They can't really be buffed, either, since actually
    threatening/lethal mimics would encourage resting before walking
    next to stairs/items/etc, at penalty of mimicy death. Neither
    doing so, nor forgetting to do so & dying, sounds very fun.
    
    So, let them focus on what they're good at. When discovered,
    mimics now cackle & vanish in a puff of smoke; this retains their
    main function ("not being [x]", surprising/annoying/amusing the
    player), without dragging out the joke longer than it's worth.
    
    The current implementation interacts oddly with effects that
    discover mimics from a distance (Ashenzari & antennae & Assassin,
    the boots of the), since mimics now vanish instantly whenever
    discovered, even if the mimic wouldn't have noticed the player
    before. It might be possible to improve this, with some
    intermediate 'semi-discovered' state?

    A twisted resurrection of phoenixes, as Bennu in Tomb
    
    As little omnipresence avatars of a creation god linked to a sun god,
    another creator god, and an afterlife god, the Bennu have a wide spread of
    capabilities: as a comparsion point, they can be roughly described as no
    haste, regular-holiness executioners with sticky flame, holy, and draining
    attacks. Yes, holy; undead have it easy in Tomb. Alongside this, they've
    also got their own version of resurrection: a one-time instant deal near
    their original spot, and where either death involves an explosion of
    ghostly fire (which, remember, checks rN and heals undead).
    
    As per usual, Tomb and extended can use more non-undead, non-demonic enemies.
    Their vulnerability to torment should be fine, considering that they've got
    a way partially around it. They're slotted vaguely into the same spots that
    ancient champions are for the Tomb subvaults (i.e. where guardian mummies
    are placed, if it's not the classic layout subvault using more of those),
    with a few weight adjustments, plus rare out-of-depth placements and a
    tiny extra placement in Tomb zig floors.

    Hellemental hellsprings (Bring back wellsprings solely within Cocytus, zigs)
    
    Unique forms of debilitation are much maligned, and so are movement-binded
    genuine dangers. Still, there are hypothetically contexts for it to work.
    The hells, which encourage diving and rushing through its levels rather
    than clearing them due to the hell effects, general low value of small
    amounts of loot, and the high plateau of player power / xp in its position,
    should be the most ideal of them. At the very least, said hell effects can
    already dump weakling fodder onto the player and throw on a random negative
    status, so a monster that can try to do a little better than that is hardly
    out of place.
    
    It also serves as part of (unique) non-demon non-undead "threats" for
    extended, as is somewhat done currently with salamander firebrands in
    Gehenna, iron golems in Dis, ghost crabs in Tartarus, and the mechanical
    gap in resistances with Ds enemies versus demons for Pan. Cocytus is
    lacking in its elemental and dangerous aspects to some extent when compared
    to the other hells, anyway; some wellsprings sprinkled throughout the branch
    and the end vaults are another equalizing buff step besides even more fiends.
    
    (Also, coc_hangedman is slightly buffed due to its generous terrain compared
    to the other Cocytus end vaults; the open water is closed in a little, and a
    few more monsters are added in a few parts. The other ends were buffed slightly,
    too, and all have some small use of wellsprings.)

    Rebalance crossbows
    
    Again as a result of the ranged weapons rebalance, crossbows
    needed to change. The analogy here is long blades' to bows'
    m&f; better return on skill investment & a higher power cap,
    but rarer.
    
    Hand crossbows are added as a starting type, "something like an
    armour-piercing dagger"; crossbows are upgraded to arbalests
    (a little worse than a glaive), and a new rare triple crossbow
    type is added on the top end (a little worse than a bardiche,
    though with a lower skill cost.) Please note that the triple
    crossbow historically existed & is extremely verisimilitudinous.
    
    Hellfire is now an arbalest, and Sniper is now a triple crossbow
    (well, a "heavy crossbow", since it has mindelay of 27 instead of
    22, and since I didn't want to have to change the sprite).
    
    All crossbows have a mindelay of at least 1.0; this is an attempt
    to differentiate them. Possibly something more ambitious will be
    attempted in 1.6, but this is a first step.

    Rebalance slings
    
    Slings numbers (along with the other launchers') needed to be
    rebalanced after the recent ranged combat rework. The approach
    here is essentially analogous to the staves skill; good return
    for xp investment, but a limited power cap, especially if you
    don't find the rare upgrade weapon type.
    
    Slings renamed to 'hunting slings' and upgraded from 2->5 base
    damage (and 12 base delay); new, rare "greatsling" added, with
    8 base damage and 14 base delay. Punk upgraded to the latter
    type.
    
    Thanks to Lasty for providing a baseline math suggestion!

    Remove potions of strong poison.
    
    Their peculiar depth restriction meant that when you found them, they were
    quite harmless. Even if the restriction were removed, they would be
    basically the same as potions of poison, since when they might be harmful
    the player would have little enough HP that the weaker potion could kill
    them.
    
    Their weight is distributed evenly among all other potions -- a very
    slight buff seems like a fine thing to do, especially since potion
    generation at D:2-10 isn't considered too good.

    Retheme arenasprint's "succubus" to "dimme".
    
    Not that it really matters, since no one actually plays
    arenasprint (no one had seen this boss in more than a year),
    but it was still kind of embarassing having it around.
    
    The new sprite isn't ideal either, but I don't have the talent
    to render "a hairy body, a lioness' head with donkey's teeth and
    ears, long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of a bird with
    sharp talons." Maybe someone else can!

    Remove the dragon slaying brand
    
    Generally it doesn't create interesting decisions because dragons are
    such a small group and are mostly a subset of monsters slowed by the
    freezing brand. In addition, it has rather arbitrary effects against
    players, hitting some for an degenerate amount of damage while ignoring
    others.

    Remove brown oozes.
    
    The idea behind them seems to be a simple upgrade to a jelly, rather
    than getting one of the more complicated and harder monsters like
    acid blobs/death oozes/azure jellies. The thing is, they generate only
    in Slime, outside vaults, and by then they're not very different from
    jellies, being mostly just "weak things that corrode." Even in the Slime
    entrance with 4 of them, which is all of them most games will see, they're
    already pretty weak. Slime itself has plenty of enemy variety and can
    stand the removal.

    Plus2: Combine all three enchant weapon scrolls
    
    New item is just called "scroll of enchant weapon".  It increases both accuracy
    and damage by 1.
    
    Enchant weapon III scrolls have been converted to stacks of 2 enchant weapon
    scrolls where placed in vaults, and if already generated will act like a common
    "scroll of enchant weapon" as well for sake of simplicity.
    
    Scroll weights have been adjusted a bit; this almost certainly
    needs to be revisited.
    
    [Committer's note: merged a few commits into this, where it seemed sensible.
    Also reworked the scroll weights, but yeah, that needs another pass.]

    Spriggan riders now ride vampire mosquitoes instead, as a more swampy
    substitute.

    Basically this has all the effects of a removal, but the elephant slug
    "stat block" remains as a dummy so Gastronok has a base type. The slugs
    even get swapped out on load for ghosts.
    
    One thing I've considered is turning Elephant Slugs into some other
    monsters, such as worms. "Slug" conveys the fact it is slow better than
    "Worm".

    better served with tomahawks before they find javelins. For one
    case where they could be useful (dispersal), tomahawks have been
    given a chance at the dispersal brand.

    The idea behind the miasma death explosion is interesting, but in

    the only place they show up outside of vaults. The retching attack
    gave a rare special case that very rarely mattered and didn't help
    to distinguish them all that much.

    Rename the bow of Krishna to the longbow of Vishnu
    
    Bad Dungeons and Dragons are bad. mm'kay?
    
    This weapon name was an insult to anyone with the slightest clue about
    how RL Hinduism works. When it comes to gods, it's all about name-length-
    vs-weight. Having two gods attached to a single bow doubles the weight,
    makes referring to it clumsy (as the context suddenly matters), increases
    air resistance, and all that to... _reduce_ accuracy -- as two mythological
    references are less deadly than one deep one, especially if any theology is
    involved. Against religion, glancing hits don't really matter, and a double
    reference can only do those.
    
    Such arguments about realism might seem like busy work to people brought up
    on MMORPGs, but some of us do care.

    Sunray had a number of quirks that were rather non-transparent if
    uninformed about them, and not usually very interesting from a
    tactical perspective (namely: it ignored repel missiles, did bonus
    damage to vampires and shadows, and couldn't hurt things that were
    invisible). There seemed a general agreement that it probably ought
    to simply be removed.

    Replace Summon Ugly Thing with Summon Menagerie (pending a better name)
    
    Summon Ugly Thing was never a particularly impressive spell and the
    summon cap changes have left it even more underwhelming these days.
    Still, there is a need for a solid midrange summon available to good
    god worshipers, and this is a shot at assembling one that might be
    more interesting than the ubiquitous ugly things.
    
    The spell can summon either a manticore, lindwurm, harpy (multiples
    at higher power), or a sphinx (much rarer except at high power), which
    I feel are solid midrange creatures with a shared mythological theme
    and some relatively unobtrusive gimmicks (and more of an emphasis
    on ranged combat than its immediate 'upgrade' in Summon Hydra).
    
    Somewhat similarly to Shadow Creatures, multiple harpies count as a
    single creature for the purposes of the spell's cap, and the creatures
    also receive a modest HD boost based on high spellpower (I'm still
    somewhat divided on this, unlike with Ice Beast, but it does help the
    spell scale more strongly with spellpower that it otherwise would;
    perhaps there is some higher-tier creature accessible with high power
    that could help bridge this gap on its own?)
    
    As a natural consequence of Summon Ugly Thing being replaced, Kirke
    also acquires this spell. This is effectively a buff for her, but as
    one of the least dangerous midgame uniques, I am sure she can handle it,
    and a selection of Greek mythological beasts are surely at least as
    suitable things for her to summon as... whatever ugly things are.

    Remove Demonic Horde
    
    This was neither a popular nor powerful nor especially interesting
    spell, which was basically 'Call Imp, except a lot more of them'.
    Making the demons more individually powerful only further steps on
    the toes of the many other demon summoning spells that already
    exist, so I think it is fine to simply trim it.

    Borrows the player tile for vine stalkers to give them a tile; these

    tiles!
    
    Since felid enemies revive now, they've been removed from a couple of
    vaults where they could get killed on D:1 and respawn outside the vault,
    killing unaware players; the ideal behaviour here would probably involve
    them respawning inside the vault, but figuring out how to do that is a
    problem unto itself.
    
    A couple of cases where enemies could spawn with equipment
    unintentionally have also gone away.

     * Tukima's: Nerf blink_other statues health, actually give them
       a cast message against their given targets.
     * Eringya: Regulate faun/satyr placement a bit more,
       move the vine coverings from stone golems to earth elementals.
     * Doroklohe: Another large buff to golem set (now constructs set)
       as part of the upcoming golems trimming. Means doroklohe has a
       consistently ridiculous threat, at least.
     * Iskendrun: Fix deep elf mage spellset to properly emulate
       the base monster's spell set, randomize the door into the tower,
       some header clean-up.
     * Zonguldrok: Cut one ancient champion and make a gravestone-champion
       have a much worse chance that also delays his placement.
     * Cigotuvi: fix an unintended potential drop in loot,
       nerf the buffed renamed tentacled monstrosity due to constriction
       buff from ages back, use iron golem as base for flesh golem
       and edit description to explain any potential catches of the base
     * Wucad Mu: Upgrade several monks (iron troll to grey draconian monk,
       human to monstrous demonspawn), let wucad mu summon them and some
       thematic ghosts so it's much harder to kill him, heavily lower
       his health. Also, extend vault exploration length, and lower
       the maximum delay between effects from 400 aut to 300.
       [somewhat annoyingly, this involves quite a hack regarding
       ds bands, some bugs block vault redefinition of ds/dr, and
       the OCS boss is also still mediocre while disint is binary.
       Going to leave things ready for redefining monks again if the above
       bugs are fixed eventually.]
     * Lots of basically important tiny things, like clothing some
       unarmoured wizards.

    Crystal golem -> Crystal guardian (Grunt, tenofswords).
    
    Implementer's notes (Grunt):
    
    The spell Crystal Bolt is player-castable for possible future use with the
    "rod of bolts" (reworked rod of destruction), and crystal golems have been
    replaced 1:1 in vaults that used them.
    
    ---
    
    Designer's notes (tenofswords):
    
    Not every golem can be cut without scarring many a vault, and golems are
    very strongly themed to the point of reluctance with complete cuts.
    Still, they're golems, slow melee-only monsters with extreme defenses and
    excellent melee that thus encourage annoying tactics due to being unable
    to kill patient players but also being very difficult to kill. We certainly
    don't need nearly versions of this sort of monster as we currently do
    (goliath beetle, slugs and snails, golems, iron trolls, iron imp/devil,
    earth elemental); the only time this really works is in Dis, where
    there are hell effects and very nasty company to make sure that there's
    no time to use the slow strategies of avoiding being hurt much by golems.
    
    This serves as another change to a slow, melee-only monster for preserving
    some themes and flavours without outright cutting into the monsters available.
    These new crystal guardians once more have good defense and even better
    resists in exchange for bad health and zero EV, appear in numbers in most
    vaults, are boosted (to normal) speed, and get a ranged option; in this
    case, a bolt of fire or cold that happens to bounce off all walls, rather
    than just crystal, easily resisted by the caster in ricchoets. This is
    modelled off the decent-enough edits on minmay_guarded_unrand_dyrovepreva,
    and the name originates from there, too.
    
    Between crystal guardians and war gargoyles as less terrible material,
    I've got plans to edit out stone golems, clay golems, and iron golems
    out from basically everywhere but Dis:7 vaults, which should pave the
    way for essentially removing these three and dealing a decent blow to
    the multitudes of slow, melee-only, very difficult to destroy encounters
    in sheer differences of monsters, though mostly by changing vault-specific
    mediocre monsters rather than significantly impacting overall monster sets.
    For now, the patch has a near 1:1 replacement use with crystal golems, aside
    from most importantly adjusting (and upping) their use as rare D:12-16 OODs.
    
    Needs a new tile.

    Buff, speed up, move around metal gargoyles, rename to war gargoyles
    
    For monsters partially representative of one of the strongest current
    races plus primarily Dis:$ spawns, metal gargoyles are quite weak.
    While low health and few resists lets them be much more palatable
    as part of the group of slow, high defense pure-melee monsters, said
    group is very full and these serve as autofight-material at best.
    Thus, this patch gives them buffs to fit into a particular niche:
    fast, high ac, low hp, nasty ranged.
    
    This renames metal gargoyles and uses a flavour of explicit
    smithing preperation to buff their speed, give them maces, and lets
    them use a slightly weaker form of iron dragon metal splinters.
    Of course, there are also a few general stat buffs: rough health
    of deep troll shamans, the damage of merfolk impalers, see invisible.
    Imagine them as stone giants with halved health and less melee damage
    in exchange for haste, mild resists, weapons, and golem-level AC.
    
    It also adjusts their vault uses, and puts them as rare Vaults OOD
    spawns for both more V to D distinction and extra flavour.
    
    Further monster gargoyle changes echoing this would be appropiate;
    molten gargoyles with lava breath and higher HD for AF_FIRE to
    address the low focus on fire damage in Gehenna, rare occasional
    plain gargoyles a little harder hitting. Using these gargoyles to
    replace most iron golem uses would also be worthwhile; this was
    recently prompted by getting something to replace some vault golems
    with.
    
    TODO: Get a new tile that can show weapons or at least _a_ weapon.

    An HD 16 naga sharpshooter who also comes with various Blink spells,
    inherent Phase Shift, and a Shroud of Golubria that she can renew if it
    gets broken.
    
    Appears on Snake:2-.
    
    Historical note: Vashnia's original design had Disjunction as an escape
    spell; currently the escape spell is Blink Other, which accomplishes
    basically the same thing but with less visual impressiveness. Perhaps at
    a later date the possibility of this can be revisited.

    Stat-wise, they were extremely similar to lava worms (just slightly

    they don't even really show up in the very narrow earlygame window
    where you might be able to even notice the differences between the two.
    
    Where lava fish occured, I have mostly replaced them directly with worms,
    barring a minor exception or two.

    Remove caps; rename wizards hats "hats."
    
    In the spirit of the glove/gauntlet and helmet types distinction removal, there
    doesn't seem to be much reason to have both caps and wizard hats. Hats are more
    common among unrands and wizards starting with hats is more "thematic" than
    some gladiators starting with caps. on the other hand, those gladiators starting
    with wizard hats would be pretty weird, so wizard hats are just hats now.
    
    Caps not removed:
    - Caps existing in old saves
    - Summon cap
    - Level cap
    
    This changes the percentages of hat brands from 2/3 MR and 1/3 int to 1/3 MR,
    1/3 int, and 1/3 spirit shield.

    overlaying icons on other readily available tiles.

    Enums for the monster spells/abilities missing tiles.
    
    These turn up in ?/S, and use question marks until we get actual tiles
    for them (fortunately a lot of them are low-hanging targets).
    
    Some spells that were formerly player spells (Berserker Rage, Symbol of
    Torment) still have old tiles; this re-enables those tiles. Also, some
    monster spells duplicate divine abilities, and the enums for those point
    at the appropriate invocation icons.

    Hopefully this will serve as motivation to get something better?

    - chitin skin (+3 AC)
    - most weapons 1-handed, big weapons 2-handed
    - permanent stasis
    - ability to shaft self
    - ability to dig
    - Starts with 2 curing pots
    
    3 monster versions of formicids were added:
    formicid, a weak fighter
    formicid drone, a stronger fighter
    formicid venom mage, a magician with olgreb's and mass cure poison

    Remove Deep Elf Soldiers (plus band/vault adjustments)
    
    Stat-wise, these were virtually identical to orc wizards in every
    way (except for somewhat better equipment), very weak for the branch
    they appeared in, and simply a plain worse version of another common
    (and not-so-scary) monster already in that same branch.
    
    Vault-wise, most uses of soldiers have been replaced with fighters.
    Sometimes the total number of them was decreased a little, and in one
    case a very early vault was shifted deeper, though most cases seem
    like they could handle an outright buff without much of consequence
    changing.
    
    The contents of the deep elf bands that used them has been altered
    somewhat. Fighter and knight bands are somewhat smaller, with fighters
    taking up the largest part of the slack for the missing soldiers, but
    there is also an increased presence of (improved) mages, along with a
    few other tweaks. On the whole, there should be somewhat fewer elves
    together, but the ones that are present should be more notable.

    Let stone wall tiles vary by console colour.
    
    It might not be the best idea to be varying stone wall colours to begin
    with, but at the very least doing this will help us identify vaults that
    need changing.

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    Specifically, spriggan enchanters (based on the base spriggan and the

    cues taken from orc knights).
    
    These aren't *too* terrible, I hope.

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    Display a different overlay when player or monster held by a web
    
    For now it's a semi-transparent version of a normal web. It
    doesn't look perfect but a fully-opaque version almost completely
    masked the image underneath. Should perhaps get a new image for
    this, with thinner strands and no or thinner outline.
    
    player_caught_in_net no longer calls redraw_screen - otherwise
    there would be a glimpse of a web over the player before the
    item on the ground both existed and was set as "stationary" to
    mark it as the trapping net (for thrown nets). The screen
    seems to get redrawn shortly after anyway.

    Add an %alpha directive for tile processors
    
    Alpha is applied after all other recolour filters. It multiples the alpha
    channel of the image by a given value in the range [1..255]. 0 is not
    allowed as this would just make the image fully transparent. 127 is 50%
    transparency, 255 is equivalent to no change.
    
    The syntax is: %alpha [value]

    Webtiles: Do animations on the client and, optionally, in real-time.
    
    Real-time animations are just an experiment and have to be enabled in
    the F10 dialog, but this has an advantage even if I choose to remove
    them: It prevents a lot of unnecessary tile updates (and thus
    bandwidth), especially in places with a lot of water or lava.
    
    Real-time animated torches, altars and wizlab portals look good;
    dungeon water and lava doesn't look too bad, but is annoying; and
    shoals water is very bad.

    2 files are added to the root of the repository:

    the dat/, saves/, etc. directories go, because the "install" part of the make
    isn't the final destination for these files under Android - the environment we
    deploy to is a separate device from the build environment.
    
    There is also a number of changes to the tiles interface. Some are specific
    to the TOUCH_UI, but others are also changed in USE_TILE_LOCAL.
    
    Touch only:
    * 'a'bilities menu goes straight to menu without prompting first
    * tap menu header to toggle/submit
    * menu instead of prompt to select which corpse to butcher
    * same for eating food from the floor (those 2 could go in local tiles too)
    * show_more defaults to false and less --more-- messages
    * pickup mode defaults to menu
    * defaults for tile_layout_priority is different (commands are more
      important than inventory)
    * popup for yes/no prompts, level-up stat gain and swapping rings (should
      be used for all prompts, and probably local tiles too)
    * spell casting: force selection menu
    * map mode: left-click rather than right-click for mouse mode; autotravel on
      left-click removed
    * remove skills training and memorisation panels
    
    Also local tiles (some could also be integrated in webtiles):
    * commands below description are clickable
    * clickable shopping menu (uses PrecisionMenu)
    * split the command panel in 2 (common actions and system commands)
    * add a map command panel
    * tapping or left-clicking the player is smarter:
      * picks up the item if there's one on the tile, otherwise
      * shows pick-up menu if there's several items on the tile, otherwise
      * traverses stairs (or enters a portal or shop) if one is present, otherwise
      * prays if an altar is present, otherwise
      * waits one turn
    * right-clicking the map enters map mode and brings the map commands tab to
      the front; map mode stays until exited rather than upon release of mouse
    
    Some more details can be found in android_patch_notes.txt on #5677 (although
    some TODOs are already obsolete).

    Allow specification of only one of image or code handling in tilegen.
    
    This allows the image and the code to be built independently; thus their
    dependencies can be (and now are) checked separately, preventing code
    from being rebuilt when only tile images have been updated (as opposed
    to the dc-*.txt definitions of the images, which are a dependency for
    both the image ant the code).

    Prevent spurious tile file rebuilds.
    
    The time stamps of rltiles/tiledef-* and rltiltes/tileinfo-* weren't
    being updated due to the code refusing to overwrite the files if they
    hadn't changed; this was confusing the Makefile into attempting to
    regenerate the tiles even if they didn't need to be regenerated. The
    code now unconditionally overwrites the files when they needed to be
    generated.
    
    This also fixes an issue where the dependency files for the images was
    incorrect when doing a non-tiles build - the wrong path for some images
    was not turning up on account of not checking to see if the provided
    file name existed. This has been addressed. (I suspect that this was the
    root cause of the issue that originally motivated the introduction of
    checking to see if the file needing to be overwritten.)
    
    Some now-needless functionality related to the above has been removed;
    if it's needed again in the future, it can be pulled from the revision
    history.
    
    This partially reverts commit 5d812b3a48325e4c98a24bd036cba34cb9c9747f.

    A L2 spell that lets you get the rune from Tomb:3 without seeing a single
    mummy there or lets you pick through the loot on a late Zig level at your

    certain places if you know how to use it (while being near-useless most of
    the rest of the time) and I don't see much hope of balancing it.

    This highlights the path taken during the last exploration or travel,

    In console, it is indicated with COLFLAG_REVERSE, which I'm not sure
    is the best option, but just changing the floor colour didn't seem

    removed from one ossuary.

    the clock still ran backwards with the fix. I changed that, but maybe

    Remove scrolls of detect curse.
    
    These scrolls simultaneously encouraged scummy behavior (collecting dozens of
    weapons/armour to detect curses on all of them at once) and were pretty much
    junk after early game (because remove curse is common and you probably don't
    actually want to try out every weapon in the game because of distortion
    anyway).
    
    I tried to change other scroll generation probabilities as little as possible,
    but this means something like a 3-5% increase for most scrolls, and about 15%
    for remove curse (as very partial compensation). The scroll generation code is
    a bit cleaner now.
    
    Upgraded games have detect curse converted to remove curse.

    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    Fix #5133: secret door positions revealed next to walls with redefined tiles.
    
    This was a regression from my tilepick.cc changes. Since the tile
    picking code now operates on map_knowledge, it didn't know about the
    undetected secret door and thus didn't use the tile override from
    adjacent tiles.
    
    This is a bit of a problem with tile_flv, which on the one hand is
    player-accessible (parts of it get transmitted to the webtiles client,
    for example), but on the other hand could contain "secret" data, like
    in this case (maybe the only one at the moment). (Note that this
    "secret" data didn't actually get sent to the client, but it could
    easily have been if more tile picking logic was on the client side.)
    
    I've opted to fix up tile_flv directly in tile_init_flavour, so that
    secret doors take the tile override of their neighbours. Of course,
    that causes the problem that the tile override is still there when the
    secret door gets turned into an open door, which resulted in an
    assert ("non-door tile").
    
    That's why now, only certain tiles are allowed as door overrides; all
    others simply do nothing for doors since they are assumed have been
    set for undetected secret doors. It also means that you can either
    override the appearance of an undetected secret door, or its
    appearance after detection, but not both. I don't think that was done
    anywhere, but if it was, a more complicated solution might be
    necessary.

    Avoid spurious regeneration of tiledef headers.
    
    tilegen had a bug causing it to think that small (< 1024 byte) files had
    changed when they had not.  This resulted in tiledef-dngn.h (and thus
    the source files that depended on that) being regenerated even when
    nothing had changed.  Whether the bug triggers depends on uninitialised
    memory contents, so might or might not have shown up in a given run.

    it's still grey instead of greenish like everything else. Luckily metal is
    rare in tar.
    
    Also, I made some small comestic adjustments to tomb, so the "wall of
    skulls" still has a place in crawl. It's most obvious on tomb:1.

    Use a linear scale for monster wound descriptions.
    
    It's hard enough to get an idea of damage done from wound descriptions, no
    need to make it harder with a misleading scale.
    
    Almost dead:        1/6 => 1/5
    Severely damaged:   1/4 => 2/5
    Heavily damaged:    1/3 => 3/5
    Moderately damaged: 3/4 => 4/5

    Show halo radius in tiles.
    
    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed
    monsters) becomes packed_cell.halo, with either HALO_NONE, HALO_RANGE
    or HALO_MONSTER as value.
    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    Rotate the wall blood splat tiles so they are facing the source.
    
    The effect looks much better this way.

    Remove omndra's title screens.
    
    While I find them pretty cool, the author is unable to modify them to use
    the new title logo because he lost the source files. He also doesn't like
    them as much as Denzi's ones (style is quite different indeed).
    Put them under unused, so we can bring them back if someone can edit them
    with the new title logo.

    Add cloud with disturbance tiles for invisible monsters in cloud.
    
    This fix Mantis 2573.
    
    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.
