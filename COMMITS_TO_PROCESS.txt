    Rename honeycombs royal jellies (PleasingFungus).
    
    The name works just as well with bee themes, but also fits with the
    occasional jelly theme that vaults have. I also feel that it's a bit
    more iconic.
    
    Thankfully the bikeshed doesn't even have to change colour -- they
    were always both yellow.

    A couple more rod-related icon tweaks.
    
    This imports the rod of clouds icon from 59d031e, adds in an icon for
    Cloud Cone, and renames/moves a couple of files around.
    
    Given the number of rod/monster spells that have no icons, I would not
    be worried about creating more of them.

    is itself a normal spell does not need to exist.

    Let stone wall tiles vary by console colour.
    
    It might not be the best idea to be varying stone wall colours to begin
    with, but at the very least doing this will help us identify vaults that
    need changing.

    Match Abyss tile colours to console's (and provide tile variants).
    
    Abyss now looks considerably less boring in tiles (in a good way).
    
    Sadly, the wall_abyss tiles vary too much in hue to easily recolour
    from just dc-wall commands, so a complete re-hued set is included - all
    for the sake of ensuring it can display in any colour!

    Recolours for WALL_HALL (Elven Halls wall) tiles.
    
    This is mostly lazy, taking inspiration from the way stone walls and Zot
    walls get recoloured (spot the similarities!).
    
    It's enough to get Elf to display the way it should be shown in tiles,
    though!

    Rework forest drakes into wind drakes.
    
    A monster whose only significant ability is to push you (and clouds and
    such) away from it just isn't very interesting; ideally it has an attack
    that synergises with that attack. Since the breath attack is a blast of
    wind, why not give it another wind-related attack that works best at a
    distance, such as Airstrike?
    
    The spell set has two instances each of Airstrike and SPELL_MELEE, the
    latter being mainly to dilute the chance of Airstrike (having something
    "smiting" you too frequently just isn't very fair).
    
    I've also tinkered with the resistances, attacks, and HP a little bit to
    make things a little more coherent.
    
    In one last change, Summon Drakes now also summons wind drakes. Beware!

    Appropriate some unused tiles for forest monsters.
    
    The dryads and forest drake tiles were originally created for this
    purpose and are good fits; the tengu conjurer and warriors perhaps
    slightly less so, but they were obviously intended for this kind of
    role.
    
    The shield's been split off of the tengu warrior tile so that they can
    display external shields properly.
    
    This leaves fauns, satyrs, Pan, tengu reavers, Sojobo, and spriggan
    enchanters in need of tiles.

    This highlights the path taken during the last exploration or travel,
    and should help make travel_delay=-1 less disorienting. The path is
    cleared when the player moves otherwise.
    
    In console, it is indicated with COLFLAG_REVERSE, which I'm not sure
    is the best option, but just changing the floor colour didn't seem
    noticeable enough.

    Without the death curses, calling them mummies (and putting them on 'M') is

    bog mummy). I've put it on 'z' and made it lightgreen. They've also been
    removed from one ossuary.
    
    Thanks to |amethyst for suggesting this change.

    the clock still ran backwards with the fix. I changed that, but maybe
    it was intended?

    I really don't like the whole packed_cell thing and how many changes
    are necessary to add this kind of tile; much of packed_cell is just
    replicating flags from map_cells. I'll have to check if this can be
    simplified.

    New monster: orb spider.
    
    A spider with IOOD and the new M_MAINTAIN_RANGE flag.  Does not spawn
    randomly currently; has a vault on Spider:4-5 (default weight) for
    testing purposes.  Numbers probably need tuned, and it may need to be
    toned down with more cantrip slots.
    
    The tile is currently just a recolouring of the spider tile.  That,
    and the text, could use some improvement.

    A new (tiles) look for Tartarus (Denzi).
    
    It's much darker, and greener than before. The only problem is metal stands
    out a bit too much... I've made it use a dark metal tile in tartarus, but
    it's still grey instead of greenish like everything else. Luckily metal is
    rare in tar.
    
    Also, I made some small comestic adjustments to tomb, so the "wall of
    skulls" still has a place in crawl. It's most obvious on tomb:1.

    Fix wrong colour key handling in the rltile tool (#4824).
    
    It assumed all paletted images used colour keys; when they didn't, the
    first palette entry would be transparent. Since that was mostly the
    darkest colour, this wasn't very noticeable, but still yielded some
    artifacts for tinted floor tiles, for examples.

    packed_cell.is_haloed (which previously was only set for haloed

    There is a combined tile for silence + halo range, since this may
    often happen with Mennas, and thus should look discernable. The tiles
    may need work, though.

    Add cloud with disturbance tiles for invisible monsters in cloud.
    
    This fix Mantis 2573.
    
    I didn't do ink, forest fire, holy flames and gloom because even though they are
    supposed to be opaque clouds, it seemed unnecessary.
    
    To make the tiles, I used the unseen monster tile, filed it with 50% gray,
    blurred it and used it as a layer mask to add transparency to the clouds.
    I saved the shape as UNUSED/other/cloud_disturbance_shape.png
    This is my first tiles, so someone more skilled should be able to do better.
