    Clean up rltiles/UNUSED
    
    Removed anything that I very strongly doubted would ever be used
    or useful.
    
    Also reorganized a couple of things.

    Clean out some unused tiles that have gotten better replacements.
    
    There are three groups of tiles in this rltiles/UNUSED/monsters folder:
    tiles of monsters that have never been, tiles of monsters that were removed,
    and tiles that were replaced with significantly better ones on currently-in
    monsters. I've trimmed the last group by far as it has the least reason to
    be kept, with exceptions granted to the smaller pan/hell lord tiles and the
    old orb guardian tile.
    
    If anybody wanted to use any of those tiles, they can find them in the git
    history alongside plenty of other tile replacements that didn't get preserved
    so explicitly.
